I need to generate synthetic case notes for validating our risk detection algorithms in Alberta's social services context. 

**Project Context:**
- Target: 500 synthetic client profiles for algorithm testing
- Focus: Adult income support clients (18-64) with realistic complexity distribution
- Testing needs: Housing instability detection, mental health sentiment analysis, and service coordination patterns

**Key Requirements:**
1. Realistic demographic patterns reflecting Alberta's urban/rural split
2. Risk factor co-occurrence that mirrors actual social services populations  
3. Case complexity levels distributed as: 25% stable, 45% moderate, 25% high, 5% crisis
4. Documentation styles varying by caseworker experience levels

**Specific Validation Targets:**
- 15% of cases should include housing crisis indicators for algorithm testing
- 8% should demonstrate mental health deterioration patterns
- 12% should show successful service connection outcomes

Please help me define the population parameters and risk models that will produce realistic but completely fictional synthetic data for this validation project.
