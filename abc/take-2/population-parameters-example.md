# Population Parameters Reference Example
## Template for Synthetic Case Note Generation

### Purpose
This file provides example population parameters that the synthetic case note generator can use as reference patterns. These examples demonstrate the types of baseline data that can inform realistic demographic modeling and risk factor distributions.
