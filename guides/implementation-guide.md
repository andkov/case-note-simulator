# Case Note Simulator Implementation Guide

## Overview

The `case-note-simulator` repository is designed to generate realistic but completely fictional social services case data for testing and validating analytical workflows in the Strategic Data Analytics (SDA) unit. This guide describes the implementation approach, expert workflow, and integration with `sda-casenote-reader`.

## Repository Architecture

### 1. Expert-Driven Specification System

**Philosophy**: Domain experts define synthetic data parameters through human-readable YAML files rather than hardcoded algorithmic assumptions.

**Core Components**:
- **Client Archetypes** (`input-specifications/client-profiles.yml`): Demographic patterns and risk factor combinations
- **Case Complexity Levels** (`input-specifications/case-complexity-levels.yml`): Service intensity and documentation patterns
- **Writing Style Variations** (`input-specifications/writing-style-guides.yml`): Caseworker documentation styles
- **Project Scenarios** (`input-specifications/project-scenarios/`): Testing configurations for specific SDA projects

**Benefits**:
- Non-technical domain experts can modify synthetic data parameters
- Specifications are version-controlled and auditable
- Multiple project scenarios can be maintained simultaneously
- Clear separation between domain knowledge and technical implementation

### 2. Generation Engine Architecture

**Modular Design**: Separate R scripts handle different aspects of synthetic data generation:

- **`client-generator.R`**: Creates client demographic profiles with realistic risk factor co-occurrence
- **`note-generator.R`**: Generates case note text with authentic writing style variations
- **`complexity-controller.R`**: Orchestrates case complexity and service intensity patterns
- **`validation-framework.R`**: Ensures quality and realism of generated data

**Generation Pipeline**:
1. **Specification Loading**: Read expert-authored YAML configurations
2. **Population Generation**: Create synthetic client profiles with controlled characteristics
3. **Case Assignment**: Apply complexity levels based on client archetypes and project needs
4. **Text Generation**: Produce case notes using appropriate writing styles and terminology
5. **Quality Assurance**: Validate outputs for realism and eliminate identifying patterns
6. **Export Formatting**: Structure data for seamless integration with SDA analytical workflows

### 3. Quality Validation Framework

**Multi-Level Validation**:
- **Linguistic Authenticity**: Verify appropriate social services terminology and realistic writing patterns
- **Demographic Realism**: Check population distributions against Alberta-like characteristics
- **Risk Factor Prevalence**: Validate realistic co-occurrence of client challenges
- **Temporal Patterns**: Ensure case progression follows authentic service delivery timelines

**Validation Metrics**:
- Distribution comparisons against expected population patterns
- Co-occurrence statistics for risk factors
- Writing style consistency measures
- Temporal pattern authenticity checks

## Expert Workflow

### 1. Project Initiation

**Step 1**: Copy `template-scenario.yml` to create project-specific configuration
**Step 2**: Define testing objectives and target algorithms
**Step 3**: Specify required synthetic data patterns and characteristics
**Step 4**: Set validation targets and quality criteria

### 2. Specification Customization

**Client Population Design**:
```yaml
population_parameters:
  total_clients: 500
  risk_distribution:
    low_risk: 0.35
    moderate_risk: 0.40  
    high_risk: 0.25
```

**Algorithm Testing Requirements**:
```yaml
validation_targets:
  housing_risk_detection: 0.95
  substance_use_flagging: 0.88
  crisis_prediction: 0.85
```

**Quality Assurance Criteria**:
```yaml
quality_checks:
  terminology_appropriateness: true
  writing_style_variation: true
  temporal_pattern_realism: true
```

### 3. Generation and Validation

**Generate Synthetic Data**:
```r
# Load generation functions
source("./generation-engine/client-generator.R")

# Generate population for specific project
clients <- generate_client_population(
  n_clients = 500,
  scenario_file = "./input-specifications/project-scenarios/risk-assessment-validation.yml"
)

# Validate generated population
validation <- validate_client_population(clients)
```

**Quality Review Process**:
1. Review generated client profiles for demographic realism
2. Check risk factor distributions against expected patterns
3. Validate case note samples for linguistic authenticity
4. Verify temporal patterns match service delivery norms

### 4. Export for SDA Integration

**Formatted Export**:
```r
export_client_population(
  clients,
  "./output-datasets/client-profiles/risk_validation_clients.csv"
)
```

## Integration with sda-casenote-reader

### 1. Data Format Compatibility

**Standardized Structure**: Synthetic data exported in formats directly compatible with SDA analytical workflows:
- Consistent client ID systems
- Matching temporal patterns
- Preserved risk factor encoding
- Compatible text formatting

### 2. Testing Harness

**Benchmark Testing**:
```r
# Export synthetic data in SDA-compatible format
export_to_sda_format(synthetic_dataset, "./testing-harness/sda_test_data.csv")

# Run SDA algorithms on synthetic data
test_analysis_pipeline("./testing-harness/sda_test_data.csv")
```

**Performance Validation**:
- Compare algorithm performance on synthetic vs. anonymized real data
- Verify known positive cases trigger appropriate risk flags
- Ensure control cases don't generate false positives
- Test algorithm stability across different synthetic data generations

### 3. Iterative Refinement

**Feedback Loop**:
1. Generate initial synthetic dataset using expert specifications
2. Run SDA algorithms on synthetic data to establish baseline performance
3. Compare results to validation targets and identify gaps
4. Adjust synthetic data specifications based on algorithm performance
5. Regenerate and retest until validation targets are met
