expert_calibration_notes: |
  These specifications are based on [DOMAIN EXPERT TO FILL]:
  - Historical caseload analysis from [DATE RANGE]
  - Risk factor prevalence rates from [DATA SOURCE]
  - Service engagement patterns from [PROGRAM EVALUATION]
  
  Key calibration decisions:
  - Risk factor probabilities reflect observed co-occurrence patterns
  - Age distributions weighted toward working-age population
  - Service duration based on program completion statistics
  - Geographic distribution reflects Alberta urban/rural split
  
  Validation against real data:
  - Compare generated risk factor distributions to historical patterns
  - Verify service engagement duration matches program averages
  - Ensure demographic realism while maintaining fictional status
