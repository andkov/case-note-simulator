# EXPERT CALIBRATION NOTES
# Domain expert guidance for authentic writing style modeling
# ===============================================================================
expert_calibration_notes: |
  Writing style specifications based on:
  - Review of anonymized case notes from [DATE RANGE]
  - Caseworker training materials and documentation standards
  - Professional development workshops on documentation practices
  - Supervisor feedback patterns on note quality
  
  Key authenticity factors:
  - Error rates calibrated to realistic human documentation patterns
  - Terminology variations reflect different professional backgrounds
  - Formatting preferences based on observed caseworker practices
  - Content depth correlated with caseload size and time constraints
  
  Validation approach:
  - Compare generated notes to authentic samples for style consistency
  - Verify terminology usage matches professional standards
  - Ensure error patterns reflect realistic human inconsistencies
  - Test readability and professional appropriateness
