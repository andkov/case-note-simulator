# The F.O.C.U.S. Framework

The F.O.C.U.S. Framework is a simple and practical method for structuring your work before engaging with AI. It helps ensure that your prompts, context, and expectations are clearly defined — allowing AI to collaborate effectively and deliver meaningful results.

## F — Frame the Problem
Begin by clearly defining the goal or challenge you are addressing.  
Ask yourself: **What do I actually need help with, and why does it matter?**  
Clarity at this stage ensures the AI focuses on solving the right problem.

## O — Opportunity for AI
Determine where AI can add value.  
Perhaps it can enhance speed, accuracy, or pattern recognition — helping you see insights that might otherwise remain hidden.

## C — Context and Content
Define the environment in which the AI will operate and what information it can safely access or rely upon.  
The richer and more accurate the context, the more relevant and precise the AI’s responses will be.

## U — User Intent and Instructions
Specify your intent and provide clear instructions for the AI.  
This is where the RICECO framework supports you — outlining the AI’s role, the inputs, and the expected behavior during the task.

## S — Structure the Output
Set expectations for what success looks like.  
Whether the output is a summary, a table, or a short draft, defining the desired format ensures the AI delivers something useful and aligned the first time.
