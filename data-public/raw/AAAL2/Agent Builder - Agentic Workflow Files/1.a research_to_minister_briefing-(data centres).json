But “if you take economics seriously, you have to look at the whole competitive landscape.” Relying on gas for the power-hungry facilities will be “too little, too late” to compete with places like China, which added 93 gigawatts (GW) of solar power and 26 GW of wind power in May alone, Lovins said. Modern renewables win against fossil generation on cost, speed, and resilience, and there are many examples of renewables running large, heavy industries “very reliably and with superior economics.” “Anybody who doesn&#8217;t realize that and discounts renewables&nbsp; as a potential way to run Alberta data centres is not paying attention,” Lovins said, producing the risk that “they will kill the data centre industry they&#8217;re hoping to create.” A Strategy Built on Gas The province announced its AI data centre strategy this past December, aiming to position Alberta as a “destination of choice for AI infrastructure.” From the outset, however, the plan focused heavily on the benefits of data centres for the province’s gas industry. The data centre plan would create “significantly increased drilling, exploration, and production activity in rural Alberta,” provincial Technology and Innovation Minister Nate Glubish said in a release. “It’s going to allow for increased distribution investment to get the gas to the different markets that need it, and it’s going to generate significant incremental natural gas royalty revenues for the benefit of all Albertans.” But some Albertans are not yet convinced of the benefits of AI data centres for their communities, and are pushing back.

Subscribe Today View our latest digests An AI data centre proposal northeast of Calgary was recently rejected by Rocky View County local officials, with neighbouring farmers and residents cheering the decision, CBC News reported . The 1,864- megawatt Greenlight Electricity Centre proposed by Kineticor had already been allocated electricity by the Alberta Electricity System Operator (AESO) for its first phase. But when more than 50 presenters opposed the proposal at a public hearing, with only four speaking in favour, plans for the project’s six data centres, a reservoir, and a gas generation facility were put on hold. Opponents raised concerns about losing prime farmland, and about high water consumption during drought, which farmers experienced first-hand in 2023. A Levy and a ‘Power Cap’ Developers looking to build in Alberta also faced hurdles from the province. In late August, they were notified of a 2% levy on computer hardware for all facilities seeking to draw 75 megawatts (MW) or more from the grid. Facilities that generate their own electricity—most likely with gas—are exempt. The levy will eventually be offset by corporate income taxes. Municipalities will still collect property taxes on land and buildings, but the province will assess data centres as “industrial properties” to collect the levy. Rural Municipalities Association (RMA) President Kara Westerlund said in an email to The Mix they are “seeking clarity from the government on why a decision was made to determine rates for a provincial levy using municipal property assessment methodology.” “RMA plans to advocate with the government to ensure that municipalities receive a share of benefits from data centre development that reflects their local role in providing infrastructure, land, and managing local impacts of such large-scale developments,” Westerlund said. Alberta Finance Minister Nate Horner said in a release the levy “ensures data centres pay their share for the infrastructure and services that support them.” At the same time, with 29 data centre projects requesting more than 16,000 MW of electricity, the province “cannot possibly connect all that,” AESO’s chief executive officer told the Globe and Mail in June. The province has since announced a “power cap” on the amount of electricity the grid operator would allot to data centres. The move follows what one legal expert called “a very interventionist history with all t\n\n\n---\n\n=== Key Energy Developments in Alberta: Nuclear Consultations and CCUS Investments ===\nSkip to content Key Energy Developments in Alberta: Nuclear Consultations and CCUS Investments &nbsp; About About Us Contact Us Our Team Careers Vantage About Vantage Market Intelligence Position Optimization Offset Insight EV Credits Aggregator Vantage Carbon Intelligence Platform A central source of reliable information empowering decisive, timely action in the carbon markets.

Premier Danielle Smith emphasized that these consultations will be a key step in gauging public sentiment and informing future energy development decisions. The province is seeking to reduce its dependency on natural gas, which is its primary source of power generation, particularly for remote industrial areas such as oil sands operations, which typically rely heavily on energy-intensive steam injection. Alberta’s oil sands sector has sparked interest in nuclear as a scalable, low-carbon power source. Nuclear power currently does not contribute to Alberta’s electricity grid, while it plays a prominent role in other areas of the country, such as Ontario. Alberta’s Shift: Context for Energy Policy and Transition The province is considering small modular reactors (SMRs), which are compact reactors ideal for on‑site power at oilsands or other industrial hubs in remote areas. They are also considering larger reactors, and a recent proposal may include building 2–4 reactors near Peace River, capable of delivering up to 4.8 GW of electricity. This would significantly boost capacity for heavy industry and potential AI data centres Ontario provides a valuable blueprint for Alberta as it explores nuclear power, given its on nuclear for 60% of its electricity. Ontario’s leadership in deploying SMRs, demonstrates how early investment, streamlined regulation, and pairing nuclear with industrial demand (like AI data centres) can drive clean energy innovation and economic development. While key specifics, such as the format of the consultations, the types of nuclear technologies under consideration, or whether construction is likely in the near future remain to be seen, the intent for consultations mark a next step in Alberta’s energy policymaking, inviting public input into nuclear power discussions after years of stalled proposals. Note that Alberta has long been at odds with the federal government over its Clean Electricity Regulations (CER), largely due to its heavy reliance on natural gas for electricity generation. To that end, exploring nuclear may potentially ease some tensions with the federal government on Alberta’s ability to meet the CER targets.&nbsp; Introducing CCUS: New Frontiers in Carbon Management In addition, on 4 July, 2025, Natural Resources Canada announced an investment of over CAD 21.5 million in five Alberta-based carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) demonstration projects, building on a broader federal commitment through 2027 aimed at maturing CCUS technologies as part of Canada’s clean energy strategy. The CCUS projects aim to directly reduce emissions from hard-to-abate sectors, presenting as tools to lower carbon intensity without halting fossil fuel activity. Meanwhile, the anticipated public consultations on nuclear power suggest a future energy mix less reliant on fossil fuels to power industrial growth. Next Steps and Impacts on Carbon Markets These two developments underscore a broader energy approach and carry potential implications for the Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) system, the province’s industrial carbon pricing program. Both nuclear and CCUS can lower emissions from Alberta’s industrial and power sectors, nuclear by reducing the carbon intensity of the power grid, and CCUS by reducing on-site emissions, which in turn could reduce compliance obligations or generate credits under the program. The TIER market is currently structurally oversupplied, compounded by political uncertainty with regard to the upcoming 2026 benchmark review, which will strengthen and refine industrial carbon\n\n\n---\n\n=== News | Alberta.ca ===\nNews | Alberta.ca Skip to content Notifications Government mail service may be affected by the Canada Post labour disruption.

As nations compete to lead in this transformative field, Canada—and Alberta specifically—offers significant strengths. Federal support is clear, with the Liberal government's Canadian Sovereign AI Compute Strategy and recent statements by Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre emphasizing bipartisan commitment to AI infrastructure. This ensures that, regardless of the outcome of the next federal election, Canada will prioritize the development of this critical sector. At the provincial level, Alberta is leveraging its strong and growing technology sector to position itself as a leader. In 2024, the Alberta Government identified the data centre industry as central to its economic diversification strategy. This commitment was reinforced with the release of Alberta's AI Data Centre Strategy , which highlights the province's unique advantages and plans for supporting this vital industry. Alberta's C$100-Billion Opportunity The surge in cloud computing, AI and machine learning is driving unprecedented demand for data centres, which require vast amounts of computing power. With national security concerns tied to data storage, the United States and Canada must reduce reliance on foreign-located facilities. According to Alberta's strategy document, global demand for data centre capacity is expected to more than triple by 2030. Data centre development represents a potential C$75-billion to C$100-billion economic opportunity for Alberta, according to Invest Alberta CEO Rick Christiaanse. The province already hosts over 20 data centres near Calgary and Edmonton, with six additional projects in early stages. These include a C$750-million facility near Calgary and a C$70-billion project in Grande Prairie. This growth comes with immense energy requirements. Global projections estimate data centres could consume 1,400 TWh annually by 2030, highlighting the importance of aligning development with energy solutions. International developers and local power producers are taking notice, working to address the complexities of scaling these massive projects. Alberta's government remains committed to supporting developers as they navigate these challenges, cementing the province's role as a leader in the industry. The Alberta Advantage The Alberta's AI Data Centre Strategy is an important element in the province's messaging to industry that not only is Alberta open for data centre and related digital infrastructure development, Alberta has substantial advantages over other jurisdictions which make this province ideally positioned for large data centre development. The strategy emphasizes the following key pillars: Scalable Power Generation Capability : Alberta is well-positioned to be able to develop the necessary generation to meet the 24/7 power availability requirements for data centre developers. Many other jurisdictions lack the capacity to provide the reliable power necessary to host large data centres. While the province is currently engaged in a review of certain aspects of the energy market, Alberta's energy-only market has, since inception, been reasonably effective in facilitating private sector investment in power generation. Alberta has a skilled and effective workforce with the capabilities to support new power development for this industry. As Canada's largest natural gas producer, Alberta has an abundant, reliable and affordable energy supply for power generation and has the geologic characteristics to enable carbon capture, utilization and storage, as needed. Alberta has tremendous solar and wind resources and is a hub for renewable energy development. Access to both reliable natural gas and low-carbon solutions can meet a variety of needs for data centre developers. Climate and Water Advantages : Data centres produce significant amounts of heat. The necessary cooling systems are critical to enhancing their performance and efficiency. The energy and water requirements for these cooling systems can be very high. Alberta's colder climate provides ideal natural cooling capability, lowering operating costs for data centres and reducing the environmental footprint. In respect of water access, Alberta has a well-established regulatory framework to allow developers to access the necessary water supply.

opportunities in the energy industry. AI, data centres and energy supply. Energy strategy in a bifurcated world. Indigenous engagement in energy projects. Reducing global emissions through LNG exports. Canada is navigating a \"wild frontier\" in the energy industry, with a unique opportunity to forge successful and sustainable partnerships both domestically and internationally. This was the rallying call at the Energy Business Forum during the 74th Canadian Energy Executive Association (CEEA) conference in Banff, Alberta, where industry leaders gathered to share visions for the future of Canada's energy landscape. As active participants, along with other thought leaders, Bennett Jones has compiled our key takeaways from the keynote remarks, forums and panels at CEEA 74. Opportunities in Alberta’s Energy Industry Keynote speaker Alberta Premier Danielle Smith expressed her strong belief that Alberta stands at a pivotal crossroads for energy growth, with expanding international interest in Alberta's energy supply, as well as its unique opportunity to shape the future through innovative thinking and forward-looking policies. By embracing its role as a leader in the Canadian energy sector, Alberta can drive meaningful, lasting change that benefits the entire country and helps fund social programs, hospitals, schools, community centres and infrastructure across the nation. To accelerate progress, Alberta and other provinces, as the actual resource owners under the Canadian Constitution, should also take a proactive approach by negotiating directly with international investors and government authorities. Premier Smith believes that direct engagement can streamline project timelines, align stakeholders and reduce delays often caused by the federal regulatory process, ensuring that critical energy initiatives move forward efficiently. While the federal government may have some involvement in establishing international trade rules, Premier Smith believes that the provinces should not wait around for the federal government to lead this charge. While there is cautious optimism in the sector around the One Canadian Economy Act , energy leaders understand that optimism alone is not enough. The Act must be supported by decisive action with federal and provincial governments working collaboratively to, as one panel aptly put it, get \"stuff\" done. This requires a shared commitment to breaking down bureaucratic barriers and fostering an environment where energy projects can thrive. Presently, there is simply too much regulatory policy slowing down the industry. Premier Danielle Smith also discussed how Alberta also has the potential to lead in renewable energy development, demonstrating that the future of energy is about an inclusive mix. By leveraging its existing expertise in energy infrastructure and innovation, Alberta is uniquely poised to integrate renewables into its energy portfolio while continuing to support traditional energy sources. This balanced approach ensures economic stability, environmental responsibility and long-term energy security, proving that growth in renewables and traditional energy can coexist and drive a sustainable future—an \"all of the above\" approach. Today's reality, however, is that the sun doesn't always shine, the wind doesn't always blow, hydro-power in Alberta is negligible and nuclear power (for example, small modular reactors) are still a decade away, meaning that our oil and natural gas will realistically have to power most of our Alberta energy and serve as our baseload in the near future. Premier Smith explained to the attendees that our Confederation consists of equal federal and provincial levels of government, not superior/inferior ones, which has meant Alberta has had to challenge the federal government when it strays from its proper jurisdictional lane. She cited two recent litigation successes (the plastics ban and Impact Assessment Act challenge, the latter involving representation from Bennett Jones) where the courts have agreed with Alberta's constitutional views. Former Texas Governor and US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, another entertaining keynote speaker, shared valuable lessons and strategies from Texas's success in becoming an energy superpower, a magnet for investment-driven growth and building a strong and educated workforce.

Business News Alberta introduces new levy framework for AI data centres Alberta is introducing a levy framework for large-scale data centres to attract investment, create jobs and ensure Albertans benefit from this fast-growing sector. Effective Dec. 31, 2026, a two-percent levy on computer hardware will apply to grid-connected data centres of 75 megawatts or greater. To maintain Alberta’s position as one of the most attractive jurisdictions in North America, the levy will be fully offset against provincial corporate income taxes. Once a data centre becomes profitable and pays corporate income tax in Alberta, the levy will not result in any additional tax burden. To ensure consistency across Alberta communities, data centres of 75 MW or greater will be formally recognized as designated industrial properties, with property values assessed by the province. Land and buildings associated with data centres are subject to municipal taxation, and municipalities may offer property tax incentives or deferrals for up to 15 years under existing provisions of the Municipal Government Act . Find out more Alberta’s government is launching the Alberta Wallet Albertans will have the option to carry their Government of Alberta-issued documents on their phones with the Mobile Health Card being the first document available for Albertans to add to the Alberta Wallet. This is part of the province’s health card modernization initiative and commitment to delivering better, faster and smarter services. The Alberta Wallet and Mobile Health Card are protected by strong encryptions, ensuring that Albertans’ personal information stays private and accessible only to them. Albertans will also be in control of their personal information as nothing is shared with third parties without their consent. To access the wallet, Albertans will need a Verified Alberta.ca Account and a MyHealth Records account to add their Mobile Health Card. More documents will be added over time and Albertans will be able to access them through the mobile application or online through their Verified Alberta.ca Account.

Explore pages in: Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction System Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction Regulation TIER Conventional Oil and Gas Alberta Emission Offset System TIER System contact form Overview The Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) Regulation is at the core of emissions management in Alberta. The TIER system implements Alberta’s industrial carbon pricing and emissions trading system. TIER helps industrial facilities find innovative ways to reduce emissions and invest in clean technology to stay competitive and save money. TIER regulated facilities TIER regulated facilities include those that emitted 100,000 tonnes or more of carbon dioxide equivalent (tonnes CO 2 e) per year in 2016, or any subsequent year, or those that import more than 10,000 tonnes of hydrogen annually. Facilities with emissions less than this threshold may opt-in to the regulation if the facility competes directly with another regulated facility, emits 2,000 tonnes CO 2 e or more, and belongs to an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed sector. Conventional oil and gas aggregates The owner or operator of 2 more conventional oil and gas facilities may apply to have those facilities regulated under the TIER regulation by applying to form a conventional oil and gas aggregate. More information for conventional oil and gas facilities is available on the TIER Conventional Oil and Gas sector website . Compliance obligations Under the TIER system, compliance obligations are determined based on a facility's benchmark(s), which establishes allowable emissions. Facilities can meet compliance obligations in the following ways: reduce on-site emissions including application of capture recognition tonnes submit emission offset credits submit emissions performance credits purchase fund credits by paying into the TIER Fund at the prescribed TIER Fund Price Large emitters or opted in facilities experiencing economic hardship may be able to receive economic relief through the Cost Containment Program. The Alberta Emission Offset System enables the generation of Emission Offsets Credits that may be used by regulated facilities to meet their compliance obligation under the TIER regulation. The TIER regulation was amended in December 2022 (see Order in Council 403/2022) . Proposed amendments In fall 2025, we introduced proposed updates to the TIER system to drive investment at large industrial facilities, helping companies stay competitive and protecting jobs. These changes will empower Alberta industries to invest in on-site emissions reduction technology that works for their specific businesses. Making Alberta’s successful TIER system even more effective and flexible will make industries more globally competitive while maintaining Alberta’s leadership in emissions reductions. Proposed updates to the TIER system include: Recognizing on-site emissions reduction investments as a new way for industry to comply with the TIER system in addition to the current options available, which include paying into the TIER fund or buying cr\n\n\n---\n\n=== Search news announcements | Alberta.ca ===\nSearch news announcements | Alberta.ca Skip to content Alberta.ca All services Public engagement Initiatives News About government Jobs Search Popular topics: Wildfire emergency updates Foster and kinship care Elder abuse – Get help Affordability Action Plan Reconciliation in Alberta Child care subsidy Renew your vehicle registration Employment standards Home Government Connect with government Government news News Search news announcements Search for Government of Alberta news and emergency updates.

Information on this page is subject to change. Canada has a long history as a leader on carbon pricing, with provinces such as British Columbia (2008), Quebec (2007, 2013) and Alberta (2007) pioneering various types of carbon pricing systems. Since 2019, the Pan Canadian Approach to Pricing Carbon Pollution has ensured carbon pricing is in place at similar levels of stringency across the country while maintaining flexibility for provinces and territories. Provinces and territories can design their own pricing system tailored to their needs as long as it meets federal minimum national stringency standards, also known as the federal ‘benchmark’. Minimum national stringency standards If a province or territory decides not to price pollution, or proposes a system that does not meet these standards, the federal system is put in place. The federal backstop has two parts: a regulatory charge on fossil fuels like gasoline and natural gas, known as the fuel charge a performance-based system for industries, known as the Output-Based Pricing System One or both parts can apply in a jurisdiction. Carbon pollution pricing across Canada Below are links to web resources on each jurisdiction’s carbon pricing system: Please be advised that we are continuously updating the list of resources.

            "output": "Okay, here's a comprehensive summary and analysis, tailored to prepare a briefing for your Minister on Alberta's TIER program and its impact on AI Data Centres.\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\nAlberta is pursuing an ambitious strategy to attract AI data centres, viewing them as a key driver of economic diversification and a boon for the province's natural gas industry. However, this strategy faces significant challenges. Concerns are being raised that relying heavily on natural gas to power these data centres could undermine their competitiveness against regions with cheaper, cleaner energy sources.  Furthermore, new levies and power caps imposed by the province are creating hurdles for developers.  The TIER program, Alberta's industrial carbon pricing system, is also intertwined with the development of data centers. Ultimately, Alberta needs to balance its support for the gas industry with the need for cost-effective and sustainable energy solutions to successfully attract and grow the AI data centre sector.\n\n**Key Talking Points for the Minister:**\n\n*   **Alberta's AI Data Centre Ambition:**\n    *   The province aims to become a \"destination of choice\" for AI infrastructure, believing it will stimulate economic growth, particularly in the natural gas sector.\n    *   Alberta sees a potential C$75-billion to C$100-billion economic opportunity in data centre development. There are already over 20 data centres near Calgary and Edmonton, with additional projects in the works.\n*   **The Gas-Centric Strategy and its Risks:**\n    *   The government initially emphasized the benefits of data centres for increased natural gas drilling, exploration, production, and royalty revenues.\n    *   Amory Lovins warns that relying on gas-fired power will make Alberta uncompetitive compared to regions with cheaper renewable energy. Places like China are investing massively in solar and wind power.\n    *   There's a risk that a gas-centric approach could \"kill the data centre industry\" Alberta hopes to create.\n*   **New Levies and Power Caps:**\n    *   The province introduced a 2% levy on computer hardware for large data centres (75 MW or greater) connected to the grid. Facilities generating their own electricity (likely with gas) are exempt.\n    *   This levy is intended to ensure data centres \"pay their share\" for infrastructure.\n    *   Municipalities will still collect property taxes.\n    *   A \"power cap\" has been announced, limiting the amount of electricity the grid operator will allocate to data centres, due to high demand (29 projects requesting over 16,000 MW).\n*   **TIER Program Implications:**\n    *   The Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) system, Alberta's industrial carbon pricing program, is relevant because data centres are energy-intensive.\n    *   Both nuclear and CCUS can lower emissions from Alberta’s industrial and power sectors, nuclear by reducing the carbon intensity of the power grid, and CCUS by reducing on-site emissions, which in turn could reduce compliance obligations or generate credits under the program.\n    *   The TIER market is currently structurally oversupplied, compounded by political uncertainty with regard to the upcoming 2026 benchmark review, which will strengthen and refine industrial carbon.\n    *   The province is planning public consultations on nuclear power, which could provide a lower-carbon alternative for powering data centres and potentially ease tensions with the federal government over clean electricity regulations.\n\n**Key Challenges & Considerations:**\n\n*   **Community Concerns:**  At least one AI data centre proposal has faced strong local opposition due to concerns about farmland loss and water consumption, highlighting the need for careful community engagement.\n*   **Renewable Energy Potential:** The province needs to seriously consider renewable energy sources (solar, wind) to power data centres to remain competitive and environmentally responsible.\n*   **Balancing Priorities:**  The government must balance its support for the natural gas industry with the need to attract data centres, which may require different energy solutions.\n*   **TIER Program Design:** The TIER program's rules and incentives could be adjusted to encourage data centres to adopt lower-emission power sources and technologies. The program is currently under review, presenting an opportunity to make these changes.\n*   **Federal Relations:** Exploring nuclear power may potentially ease some tensions with the federal government on Alberta’s ability to meet the CER targets.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Diversify Energy Sources:** Develop a strategy to encourage data centres to use a mix of energy sources, including renewables and potentially nuclear, not just natural gas.\n*   **Review TIER Program Incentives:** Assess whether the TIER program provides sufficient incentives for data centres to reduce their emissions.\n*   **Address Community Concerns:**  Implement a robust community engagement process for data centre projects to address concerns about environmental impact and resource use.\n*   **Monitor Competitiveness:** Continuously monitor the competitiveness of Alberta's data centre industry compared to other jurisdictions, taking into account energy costs, regulations, and incentives.\n*   **Clarify Municipal Roles:**  Work with the Rural Municipalities Association (RMA) to ensure municipalities receive a fair share of benefits from data centre development.\n\n**Additional Information to Gather:**\n\n*   Details of the \"power cap\" and its potential impact on data centre development.\n*   Specifics of the TIER program review and potential changes relevant to data centres.\n*   Progress on nuclear power consultations and potential timelines for SMR deployment.\n*   Attractiveness of the 2% Levy Framework for AI Data Centres\n\nBy addressing these challenges and implementing these recommendations, Alberta can increase its chances of successfully attracting and growing a sustainable AI data centre industry.\n"

Here's the completed briefing note:\n\n**ADVICE TO HONOURABLE [Minister's Name]**\n**MINISTER OF TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION**\n**FOR DECISION**\n\n**PURPOSE**\nTo provide the Minister information regarding the potential impact of Alberta's Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) program on the province's strategy to attract and develop AI data centres, and to recommend a course of action to optimize the program's effectiveness in supporting this sector. This briefing is necessary due to the upcoming review of the TIER program in 2026 and the increasing competition for AI data centre investments.\n\n**BACKGROUND**\nAlberta is actively pursuing a strategy to attract AI data centres, viewing them as a significant economic opportunity, particularly for the natural gas industry. The province estimates a potential C$75-billion to C$100-billion economic impact from data centre development and has already attracted over 20 data centres near Calgary and Edmonton. The government initially emphasized the role of these data centres in boosting natural gas demand and royalty revenues.\n\nHowever, this strategy faces challenges. Concerns have emerged that relying heavily on natural gas to power these data centres could undermine their competitiveness against regions with cheaper, cleaner energy sources. New levies on computer hardware for large data centres connected to the grid and announced power caps have also created uncertainty for developers.\n\nThe TIER program, Alberta's industrial carbon pricing system, is relevant because data centres are energy-intensive facilities. The program's design and incentives can influence data centres' decisions regarding energy sources and emissions reduction technologies. The TIER market is currently structurally oversupplied, compounded by political uncertainty with regard to the upcoming 2026 benchmark review, which will strengthen and refine industrial carbon.\n\n| Timeline      | Event                                                     |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Present       | Active pursuit of AI data centre investments              |\n| 2024          | Introduction of levies and power caps for data centres     |\n| 2026          | Scheduled review of the TIER program                     |\n\n**ANALYSIS**\nThe province's ambition to become a leading destination for AI data centres requires a balanced approach that considers both economic opportunities and environmental sustainability. The TIER program plays a crucial role in this balance, as it can incentivize data centres to adopt lower-emission power sources and technologies.\n\nRelying solely on natural gas to power data centres could make Alberta uncompetitive compared to jurisdictions with access to cheaper renewable energy. It also risks undermining the province's environmental reputation and potentially creating tensions with the federal government over clean electricity regulations.\n\n**Key Considerations**\n*   **Energy Mix Diversification:** Encouraging data centres to use a mix of energy sources, including renewables and potentially nuclear, is essential for long-term competitiveness and sustainability.\n*   **TIER Program Incentives:** The TIER program's current incentives may not be sufficient to encourage data centres to invest in lower-emission technologies. The upcoming program review provides an opportunity to strengthen these incentives.\n*   **Community Engagement:** Addressing community concerns about farmland loss and water consumption associated with data centre development is crucial for building public support and ensuring sustainable growth.\n*   **Federal Relations:** Exploring nuclear power may potentially ease some tensions with the federal government on Alberta’s ability to meet the CER targets.\n\n**Jurisdictional Comparisons**\nOther jurisdictions, such as China, are investing heavily in renewable energy sources to power their data centres. This gives them a competitive advantage in terms of energy costs and environmental footprint. A jurisdictional scan (detailed in the attached \"Jurisdictional Scan of Data Centre Energy Policies\") shows that provinces like Quebec and British Columbia, with access to abundant hydroelectric power, are actively marketing their clean energy advantage to attract data centre investments.\n\n**Minister's Mandate Alignment:** This analysis aligns with the Minister's Mandate Letter items related to:\n*   Promoting economic diversification through technology and innovation.\n*   Supporting the development of a sustainable energy sector.\n\n**Options**\n*   **Option 1 (Recommended)** Adjust the TIER program to provide stronger incentives for data centres to use lower-emission power sources, such as renewables and potentially nuclear. This could involve offering higher carbon credit values for projects that reduce emissions below a certain threshold.\n    *   Pros: Enhances Alberta's competitiveness, promotes environmental sustainability, potentially attracts federal funding for clean energy projects.\n    *   Cons: May require adjustments to the TIER program's overall budget, could face opposition from the natural gas industry.\n    *   Risks/Mitigation: Carefully model the financial impact of TIER program adjustments, engage with stakeholders from both the data centre and natural gas industries.\n\n*   **Option 2:** Maintain the status quo under the TIER program, with no specific incentives for data centres to reduce emissions.\n    *   Pros: Avoids potential disruptions to the existing TIER market, minimizes administrative burden.\n    *   Cons: Risks making Alberta uncompetitive in attracting data centres, could undermine the province's environmental reputation.\n    *   Risks/Mitigation: Monitor the competitiveness of Alberta's data centre industry and be prepared to adjust the TIER program if necessary.\n\n*   **Option 3:** Impose stricter regulations on data centre emissions through the TIER program, such as requiring them to use a certain percentage of renewable energy.\n    *   Pros: Ensures significant emissions reductions, sends a strong signal about Alberta's commitment to environmental sustainability.\n    *   Cons: Could deter data centre investments, may be difficult to enforce, could face legal challenges.\n    *   Risks/Mitigation: Conduct a thorough legal review before implementing stricter regulations, provide financial assistance to help data centres comply.\n\n**FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS**\nAdjusting the TIER program to provide stronger incentives for data centres to use lower-emission power sources could require an initial investment of $5-10 million per year. This investment would be offset by increased data centre investments and reduced emissions. (SFO approval anticipated).\n\n**STAKEHOLDER REACTION**\nKey stakeholders include:\n*   Data centre developers: Likely to support incentives for lower-emission power sources.\n*   Natural gas industry: May oppose measures that reduce demand for natural gas.\n*   Environmental groups: Likely to support stricter regulations on data centre emissions.\n*   Rural Municipalities Association (RMA): Will want to ensure municipalities receive a fair share of benefits from data centre development.\n\nConsultations with these stakeholders will be conducted by department officials in the coming weeks. Anticipated reactions include concerns about the cost of lower-emission power sources and the potential impact on the natural gas industry. Officials should emphasize the long-term benefits of a sustainable data centre industry and the need to balance economic and environmental considerations.\n\n**NEXT STEPS**\n*   Department officials will conduct consultations with key stakeholders.\n*   The TIER program will be reviewed to identify opportunities to strengthen incentives for lower-emission power sources.\n*   A strategy will be developed to encourage data centres to use a mix of energy sources, including renewables and potentially nuclear.\n*   The competitiveness of Alberta's data centre industry will be continuously monitored.\n\nThese steps will be completed by [Date - e.g., Q1 2025], with regular progress reports provided to the Minister.\n\n**ATTACHMENT**\n1.
