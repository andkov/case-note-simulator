Our Speakers. Interested at speaking at the Summit? APPLY HERE Meet the 2025 line-up Karen Hao NYT Bestselling Author and Journalist Karen Hao NYT Bestselling Author and Journalist AI is upending the planet in real time, and its path of unchecked development threatens to erode democracy and return us to an age of empire, where a small group of companies dictates our future. It doesn’t have to be this way, says Karen Hao, a Silicon Valley engineer-turned-award-winning-journalist. Karen’s epic and urgent book Empire of AI—an instant New York Times bestseller called a “heroic work” by Shoshana Zuboff (The Age of Surveillance Capitalism)—is the culmination of her years of insider access to OpenAI and her original reporting, spanning five continents. TIME, which named her to their list of the 100 most influential people in AI, writes that “Hao is fundamentally shaping many people’s perceptions and understanding of the company at the center of the AI revolution.” In captivating keynotes, packed with hard-won insights, Karen assembles the fullest picture yet of the most consequential tech arms race in history. She shows us just how thoroughly AI will alter society, and, more importantly, what role we can all play in actively shaping AI so that it benefits everyone. “The way we develop technology is now fundamentally broken,” Karen says. “But I truly believe that we can fix it.” “Our lives are about to be remade by artificial intelligence. If you ever wondered whether all of this is inevitable, whether we could save a little bit of our democracy in the age of AI, then read this book!” —Daron Acemoglu, Winner of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences Called “one of the foremost tech journalists covering AI” by Dr. Joy Buolamwini, Karen Hao writes for publications like The Atlantic and leads the Pulitzer Center’s AI Spotlight Series, which trains journalists around the world on how to cover artificial intelligence. In Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI (Penguin Press, 2025), Karen, the first journalist to ever profile OpenAI, tells the behind-the-scenes story of how a cadre of the most powerful companies in human history is reshaping the world in its image. “Excellent and deeply reported” (The New York Times), Empire of AI is an “essential work of public education” (Zuboff), “a bestselling page-turner that has made waves not just in Silicon Valley but around the world” (TIME), and a revelatory portrait of the people controlling this technology. It is the jaw-dropping story of ambition and ego, hype and speculation, plunder and destruction, politics and labor, and, of course, money and power—a brilliant and deeply necessary look at the industry defining our era, and what the future holds. Karen was formerly a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, covering American and Chinese tech companies, and a senior editor for AI at MIT Technology Review. Her work has been cited by Congress, featured in university curriculums, and remade into museum exhibits. She has won numerous accolades, including an American Humanist Media Award and a National Magazine Award for Journalists Under 30. Karen also sits on the AI advisory board of the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY. Prior to journalism, she was an application engineer at the first startup to spin out of Google, and she received a B.S. in mechanical engineering and minor in energy studies from MIT.

As one of the most digitally connected countries in Europe, the nation has long acknowledged the necessity of robust security strategies to protect both businesses and citizens alike. The Netherlands is home to a multitude of corporate technology companies, many of which focus on cyber security. As such, numerous cybersecurity conferences, events, and summits are hosted in the country each year. Notably, the cybersecurity conferences KilalaSec, Usenix, and Black Hat all take place annually in Amsterdam. On a global scale, the Netherlands is ranked as one of the safest countries for cyber security. It is one of the first countries to adopt the European Network Information Security Directive, as well as one of the earliest adopters of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation. The nation values strong collaboration and public-private partnerships, which are seen as essential in addressing cybersecurity issues as well as developing the latest solutions. The National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) works closely with government, industry leaders, and academia to detect and respond to threats in real-time, as well as to test network security systems before they go live. To promote cyber security innovation, the Netherlands also hosts an annual cybersecurity challenge, inviting developers from all over the world to participate in this unique competition. In addition, the government has allocated funds in recent years to deter cybercrime, emphasizing investment in research and action towards cyber defense.
