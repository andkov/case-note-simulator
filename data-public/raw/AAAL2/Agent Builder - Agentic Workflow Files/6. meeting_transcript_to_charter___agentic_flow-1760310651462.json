Default retention of 6 months post-closure unless otherwise required.\n*   **Tool Failure During Pilot:** (Power Apps form crashes or flow errors)\n    *   Mitigation: Staging environment testing, daily monitoring, backup manual form if outage exceeds 1 hour.\n*   **Workflow Misrouting:** (requests going to the wrong team or no team)\n    *   Mitigation: Validate routing logic with all stakeholders before go-live. Test with real-life scenarios. Maintain a catch-all inbox during pilot.\n*   **Staff Ignore the New System:** (continue using old channels)\n    *   Mitigation: Pre-pilot comms campaign, visible redirection messages, senior leader endorsement, and hard cutoff date for legacy systems.\n*   **Poor User Experience:** (leads to negative perception)\n    *   Mitigation: Simple UX, plain language, progressive rollout. Collect feedback early and act on it fast.\n*   **Privacy Breach:** (request data shared or stored incorrectly)\n    *   Mitigation: Limit field visibility, strict permissions on storage, audit trail, data retention policy enforced.\n*   **Budget Overrun**\n    *   Mitigation: Weekly finance check-ins, prioritize features, delay non-MVP work until post-pilot.\n*   **Scope Creep:**  Strictly manage scope to stay within budget and timeline.\n*   **Resistance to Change:** Address resistance from departments and staff who prefer existing processes.\n*   **Legacy Systems/Shadow IT:** Discovery of undocumented systems/forms.\n*   **Latency when submitting large requests with attachments**\n    *   Mitigation: remind users to upload readable documents. Put a tip near the attachment field.\n\n**Key Decisions:**\n\n*   **Technology Platform:** Evaluate Power Platform vs. ServiceNow. (Decision not explicitly made in the transcript, but discussion leans toward Power Platform due to cost.)\n*   **Pilot Scope:** Facilities department will be the pilot group.\n*   **MVP Requirements:** Focus on core functionality for the pilot, deferring non-essential features to later phases.\n*   **Authentication:** Only authenticated staff can submit requests.\n*   **Data Retention Policy:** Default to 6 months post-closure unless legally required otherwise.\n*   **Escalation Paths:** Define escalation paths for requests not addressed within SLA windows.\n*   **No Legacy Data Migration:** Only migrate the last 30 days of requests for reference.\n*   **Disable Shadow SharePoint Form:** Disable the form today.\n*   **Falcon is for operational service requests only**\n\n**Resource Needs:**\n\n*   **Budget:** \\$150,000 (covers licensing, tech configuration, user training, change management, potential contractors).\n*   **Potential ServiceNow Consulting:** \\$40K (if ServiceNow is chosen).\n*   **Training and Change Management Materials:** \\$20K.\n*   **Temporary Staff:** \\$10K (to manage intake volume during the pilot).\n*   **Dev Contractors:** \\$30K (if Power Platform isn't sufficient).\n*   **Privacy Review, Accessibility Audit, and Legal Consulting:** \\$35K.\n*   **Development Resources:** Need for development help (Priya mentioned this).\n*   **Technical Expertise:** Expertise in Power Platform, Power Automate, ServiceNow, SAP APIs, Azure AD, and SharePoint.\n*   **Facilities \"Super User\":** Assign one Facilities team member as the Falcon \"super user\" - someone who becomes the go-to internally.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n*   Existing M365 licenses cover the necessary Power Platform components.\n*   ServiceNow and Microsoft environments are compliant with data residency requirements (to be confirmed).\n*   Departments will cooperate in defining service categories and approval workflows.\n*   The pilot will provide valuable feedback for further development and rollout.\n*   Blocking off old channels will increase the usage of the new system.\n\nI hope this is helpful! Let me know if you need any clarification or further analysis.\n"

I'm making some assumptions about what services might exist within a typical enterprise environment. Since there's no actual service catalog provided, I'm creating hypothetical services based on common functionalities.\n\n**Important Note:**  Since these are hypothetical \"in-house\" services, I'm assuming that the \"cost\" would primarily be related to internal resource allocation and ongoing maintenance, rather than a direct monetary cost per transaction.  The \"match\" score is subjective and based on how well the service's description aligns with the project's requirements.\n\n*   **Service Name:** \"Enterprise Service Desk Platform (ESDP)\" (In-House)\n    *   **Cost:** Internal resource allocation for maintenance and support.\n    *   **Match:** 9/10\n    *   **Functions & Justification:**\n        *   **Unified Intake Portal (FR.01):**  ESDP typically provides a single point of entry for all service requests.\n        *   **Authentication (FR.02):**  Integrated with enterprise authentication (e.g., Azure AD).\n        *   **Service Catalog (FR.03):**  Offers a customizable service catalog.\n        *   **Request Submission (FR.04):**  Form-based submission with attachment capabilities.\n        *   **Routing (FR.05):**  Automated routing based on service type.\n        *   **Request Tracking (FR.06 & FR.07):**  Provides status tracking and history.\n        *   **Reporting (FR.08):**  Generates reports on key metrics.\n        *   **Approval Workflows (FR.09):**  Supports configurable approval workflows.\n        *   **Escalation (FR.10):**  Includes escalation rules based on SLAs.\n        *   **Request Closure (FR.12):**  Allows for request closure.\n        *   **Search Functionality (FR.13):**  Offers search capabilities.\n        *   **Attachment Handling (FR.14):**  Supports attachments.\n        *   **Notifications (FR.15):**  Sends notifications on status changes.\n        *   **Audit Trail (FR.17):**  Maintains an audit trail.\n        *   **Service Request Form (FR.18):** Provides a form to submit service requests\n\n*   **Service Name:** \"Enterprise Data Archival Service\" (In-House)\n    *   **Cost:** Storage costs and internal resource allocation for management.\n    *   **Match:** 7/10\n    *   **Functions & Justification:**\n        *   **Data Retention (FR.11):**  Provides automated archiving and deletion based on defined policies.\n        *   **Potentially supports aspects of Data Residency (NF.10), Disaster Recovery (NF.11), and Privacy (NF.05) if configured accordingly.**\n\n*   **Service Name:** \"Enterprise Identity and Access Management (IAM)\" (In-House)\n    *   **Cost:**  Ongoing maintenance and support of the IAM infrastructure.\n    *   **Match:** 6/10\n    *   **Functions & Justification:**\n        *   **Authentication (FR.02):** Centralized user authentication and authorization.\n        *   **Security (NF.03):**  Ensures secure access to the system.\n        *   **Integrates with Azure AD (NF.09)**\n\n*   **Service Name:** \"Enterprise Reporting and Analytics Platform\" (In-House)\n    *   **Cost:** Server maintenance, licenses (if applicable), and internal support.\n    *   **Match:** 5/10\n    *   **Functions & Justification:**\n        *   **Reporting (FR.08):** Provides tools and infrastructure for generating custom reports and dashboards.\n\n*   **Service Name:** \"Enterprise Integration Platform (EIP)\" (In-House)\n    *   **Cost:** Development and maintenance of integration connectors, server costs, and internal support.\n    *   **Match:** 6/10\n    *   **Functions & Justification:**\n        *   **Integration (NF.09):** Facilitates integration with existing systems like SAP, SharePoint, and potentially other internal applications. (Requires custom connector development.)\n\n**Explanation of Match Scores:**\n\n*   **9/10:**  A very strong match, meaning the service likely covers the majority of the relevant requirements out-of-the-box or with minimal configuration.\n*   **7/10:** A good match, but may require some configuration or customization to fully meet the requirements.\n*   **6/10:** A moderate match, meaning the service provides some of the required functionality but would need significant customization or integration with other services to fully meet the needs.\n*   **5/10:** A weak match, meaning the service only partially addresses the requirements and would likely require substantial development or a combination of other services.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Customization:**  Even with existing services, Project Falcon will likely require customization to tailor them to the specific workflow and data requirements.\n*   **Integration:**  The success of Project Falcon will depend heavily on the ability to integrate these services seamlessly.\n*   **Open Questions:**  Addressing the open questions is critical for selecting the right services and configuring them appropriately. The OQ's around integration details are particularly important.\n*   **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):**  Formal SLAs need to be defined for each service to ensure that they meet the performance and availability requirements of Project Falcon.\n*   **Data Governance:**  Data retention, privacy, and security are critical considerations that need to be addressed in the design and implementation of the system.\n\nThis analysis provides a starting point for identifying potential in-house services that can be leveraged for Project Falcon. A more detailed evaluation would be necessary to determine the best fit and to plan for any required customization and integration.\n"

Their network comprises three independent hospitals working collaboratively under the North Country Healthcare umbrella, each maintaining their autonomy while sharing resources and working towards common goals. Industry Healthcare Challenges Process Coordination: Moving from three separate entities to a unified consortium required streamlined service management. The previous platform was outdated and clunky, making it difficult to coordinate internal services across multiple facilities and departments. Employee Onboarding: The complex employee onboarding process involved six different departments, with numerous manual steps leading to frequent process breakdowns and lost requests. Cross-departmental Communication: Managing service requests across IT, HR, Maintenance, and other departments was challenging, with no unified system for tracking and routing internal requests effectively. Service Delivery: The lack of standardized processes and automation capabilities hindered efficient service delivery to employees across all facilities, resulting in delayed responses and inconsistent service quality. Growth Limitations: Their previous solution couldn't scale with their evolving needs, requiring workarounds and limiting their ability to adapt processes as the organization grew. Also, with a growing team and multiple departments needing system access, their previous per-agent licensing model became increasingly expensive and unsustainable for hospital-wide deployment. Implementation The North Country Healthcare team needed a scalable service desk solution that could unify their internal operations. After discovering HappyFox through research, they were immediately drawn to its sleek interface and comprehensive customization capabilities. Starting Small: Implementation began with the HR department to establish core processes and workflows. The team worked closely with HappyFox staff to ensure proper setup and knowledge transfer at every step. Systematic Expansion: Once HR processes were optimized, the solution was gradually rolled out to other departments including IT, Maintenance, EMR Support, Education, and various clinical services. Process Automation: The team configured Smart Rules and Happyfox Workflows to automate routine tasks, particularly focusing on streamlining the employee onboarding process across departments. Azure Integration: Integration with Azure Cloud simplified user management and authentication, providing a seamless experience for staff across all facilities.

Enterprise service management (ESM) is a strategic approach to service delivery that unifies, standardizes, and automates service within and across departments, aligning with their individual processes and workflows and driving efficiency across the organization. default {} default {} primary default {} secondary Why is ESM important? Across different business departments, the definition of a “customer” varies widely. Depending on the line of business, the people who are being served may be employees, partners, suppliers, accounts teams, citizens, or consumers. But the one thing they all have in common is questions, issues, and requests that must be resolved. For decades, IT departments have relied on established IT service management (ITSM) practices and tools to enable the delivery of IT services and support to their organizations. ESM takes the principles of service management and extends them to other departments such as HR, customer service, finance, or procurement to help streamline, harmonize, and digitalize their processes. Addressing internal customer requests frequently involves complicated, cross-departmental workflows that often include manual processing steps—slowing down issue resolution and keeping people waiting for answers. But by replacing unstructured, mundane work with modern, automation-based alternatives, ESM breaks down organizational silos and supports an integrated and customer-focused approach to delivering efficient end-to-end services. In this way, organizations improve customer experiences, boost productivity, and save costs. What does ESM involve? ESM involves a range of tools and practices that help optimize service delivery and operational efficiency across the enterprise. Key components include: Service catalogs: A centralized repository of all available services that a department provides, the service catalog includes detailed descriptions, service levels, and how to request the services. Service desks: A single point of contact for service request management, incident management, and general inquiries, the service desk acts as the primary interface between service providers and customers. Communication channels include e-mail, chat, SMS, or phone. Self-service portals: Enabling users to find answers and resolve issues independently without needing to contact the service desk, a self-service portal lets people access services, submit requests, and find information or solutions. Service level agreements (SLAs): Specifying service levels, SLAs outline the expectations and responsibilities of both service providers and customers. Automated, AI-enabled workflows: Helping ensure consistency and speeding up response times, AI-enabled workflows streamline activities by automating repetitive tasks such as case routing. Knowledge base: Providing a single, centralized repository for the collection, organization, and sharing of information to improve efficiency and service delivery. Reporting and analytics: A range of tools and processes help organizations track performance metrics, analyze service trends, and generate reports, providing insights for continuous improvement and strategic decision-making. Use cases for ESM ESM can be applied across various organizational functions to improve efficiency, streamline processes, and enhance service delivery. Common use cases for ESM include: Human resources: Payroll discrepancy management, family and medical leave support, and work permit processing are critical HR areas where ESM streamlines operations and enhances employee experiences. By automating ticket resolution and utilizing self-service portals, ESM helps employees quickly address payroll issues, initiate leave requests, and track work permit applications without extensive HR intervention. Additionally, guided experiences help employees navigate onboarding processes efficiently, ensuring they have the necessary systems access and equipment from day one. This approach not only saves time for HR teams but also empowers employees to take control of their HR needs, creating a more responsive and effective service environment. Finance: ESM automates many manual processes, including payment requests, accrual requests, invoice inquiries, and many others. AI-driven case management and digital workflow capabilities also provide a platform for finance shared services organizations to manage internal inquiries, requests, and exceptions. Customer service: Within customer service management, ESM tools and principles are at play when companies manage customer inquiries, service requests, and complaints through a unified service desk. The creation of centralized knowledge bases provides service agents with easy access to in-depth product information and guidance on specific queries, while the use of SLAs helps ensure timely and high-quality service delivery to customers.

It’s nothing exceptional (but it’s also only 15$/month). It’s not a replacement for a repair-shop first POS system, but it can help manage your store with some useful features (like email messaging and a customer portal). The dev team is quite responsive, able to help via WhatsApp within 12 hours of a message. The biggest problem with the software isn’t the software itself - it’s Shopify. Shopify isn’t built for repair shops; I’d highly recommend checking out some other softwares instead of Shopify. But if you’re using Shopify (possibly for e-commerce, maybe you’re already in a yearlong contract), unified repairs support is a good enough solution.

It allows us to collect more info from the customer and control the flow of returns so nobody's time is wasted. The free plan is awesome and we can't wait to upgrade to the paid plan so we don't have to worry about the 10 tickets per month limit. Small hiccup in upgrading. Show more LabJack United States 3 months using the app August 15, 2022 App works well for our basic needs, however, the search function to add a customer to a ticket does not allow you to properly search by name (You have to use email or phone #, if you search name every person with that name comes up). The app is very helpful in allowing us to track our machine repairs across both stores. Overall, very happy to have this app available to us and with minor tweaking, we would easily give it 5 stars.

It gives learners, faculty, and staff a unified platform to communicate, collaborate, and track progress, across departments, offices, and the student journey. Learner360 is your personalized success platform — everything you need to thrive in your academic journey. Learn more about Learner360 What is Pirate360? Pirate360 is East Carolina University’s new Enterprise CRM (Constituent Relationship Management) system. It’s designed to support our three strategic commitments: Student Success Providing more personalized support and communication Public Service Advancing learner and community partnerships Regional Transformation Ensuring ECU remains innovative and efficient At East Carolina University, we believe in the power of transformation — and in the strength of cohesion. Every Pirate’s journey is part of a larger, unified experience. One ECU. One Cohesive Journey. With Pirate360, advisors, faculty, and staff can see a full picture of student engagement, helping identify what support is needed, when it’s needed. How Pirate360 Helps Pirate360 connects the people, services, and systems that support ECU’s mission. It brings together tools from across campus to create a unified, learner-centered experience. It also improves operations behind the scenes, helping faculty and staff work more efficiently. Advising WIIFM Spotlights Supporting the Full Student Journey Pirate360 helps ECU follow and support each Pirate’s path, from prospective student to graduate to lifelong learner, while also simplifying the tools faculty and staff use every day. Learner Success Tools that help guide students from recruitment to graduation. Recruitment and Admissions Supports targeted outreach, manages applications, and tracks student interest in one system. Advising and Support Services Advisors can view a complete student profile, share notes across teams, and easily follow up. Experiential Learning Learners engage with internships, research, and high-impact academic-related experiences. Student Experience A consistent and easy-to-use platform for managing the academic journey. One-Stop Services Pirate360 lays the foundation for a centralized place where students can ask for help and track their requests. Personalized Outreach Communications can be tailored to each student’s needs using email, text, or portal messages. Support Requests Learners can initiate support requests for advising and experiential learning. Task Management Students will be able to log in and see clear next steps, such as scheduling advising or completing a required form. Institution Success Tools that help ECU operate more effectively and make informed decisions. Alumni and Donor Engagement In future phases, Pirate360 will help manage alumni relationships and fundraising campaigns. Advancement and Finance Operations Departments will be able to streamline engagement tracking and reporting by using shared tools. Faculty and Staff Experience Simplifying everyday work with better visibility and coordination. Unified Communications Instead of managing multiple tools, teams can use Pirate360 to share notes, set reminders, and communicate securely. Facilities and Internal Services Future phases may include tools for managing service requests, purchasing approvals, and other internal processes. Corporate and Community Relations Pirate360 helps ECU track partnerships and connect learners with hands-on learning opportunities in the region. Why It Matters Too often, important information about students is spread across multiple systems or tucked away in spreadsheets. That makes it hard to deliver the wraparound care students need. Pirate360 solves that. Benefits will include: A single learner profile that shows academic, advising, and engagement data Easier scheduling and communication between students and advisors Better coordination across support offices Tools for proactive outreach Fewer systems to manage—and less duplication of work When Is This Happening? Pirate360 is being rolled out in phases . The first features will go live in Fall 2025 , starting with academic advising and experiential learning tools. Visit the Timeline and Roadmap pages for more details. What’s Next? We’ll continue to add more features over time, from Support Request tools and internal services to enhance\n",

Since there's no \"in-house\" information in the FYLE or Cogni documents, I will add that into the table at the top.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n*   **Fyle & Appsmith:** Fyle, a fintech company, used Appsmith to empower their customer success team. This involved building internal tools that allowed the customer success team to self-serve customer requests, reducing the engineering team's workload. Key benefits included less engineering workload, automated service requests, and faster build times. They chose Appsmith over Retool and Internal due to ease of evaluation, good documentation, ease of building, and deployability on a private instance.\n*   **Cogni & Flexible Benefit Plan:** Cogni implemented a Flexible Benefit Plan (FBP) allowing employees to customize their benefits package. This included choices like House Rent Allowance, Medical Reimbursement, Leave Travel Allowance, and Food Reimbursement. The plan allowed employees to redefine their component selections monthly, within specified limits based on their level or grade.\n\n**Table of Options:**\n\n| Service Name          | Cost                                                                   | Requirements Match                                                                       | Pros                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Cons                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **In-House Development (General)** | High (Engineering time, maintenance, scaling)                                   | Potentially perfect (customized to exact needs)                                          | *   Full control over features and functionality.  *   Can be tailored to highly specific requirements.  *   Potential for long-term cost savings (if successful).  *   Intellectual property remains in-house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | *   High upfront development cost.  *   Requires significant engineering resources.  *   Ongoing maintenance and scaling costs.  *   Risk of project delays and failures.  *   Can divert engineering focus from core product development.  *   May lack features compared to specialized solutions.                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Appsmith              | Variable (based on usage/plan)                                         | Good (facilitated customer success self-service, reducing engineering workload)          | *   Easy to evaluate and implement.  *   Good documentation.  *   Fast build time.  *   Deployable on a private instance.  *   Empowered customer success team.  *   Reduced engineering workload.  *   Automated service requests.                                                                                                                                                                                               | *   Requires some technical expertise to build and maintain apps.  *   Potential dependency on the Appsmith platform.  *   Costs can scale with usage.  *   May not be suitable for highly complex or specialized requirements beyond its capabilities.                                                                                                                               |\n| Cogni's FBP | Cost of benefits package (variable depending on employee choices) | Good (allows employees to tailor benefits to their individual needs) | *   Increased employee satisfaction and engagement.  *   Improved benefits utilization.  *   Potential cost savings through flexible allocation.  *   Attracts and retains talent. | *   Complex administration and communication.  *   Potential for adverse selection (employees choosing benefits that are most likely to be used).  *   Requires careful design and monitoring to ensure fairness and compliance. |\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nBased on the provided information, Fyle made a sound decision to use Appsmith for their internal tool development. The platform enabled them to significantly reduce the burden on their engineering team and empower their customer success team.  For Cogni, implementing a Flexible Benefit Plan is a strong move to attract and retain employees by catering to their individual needs. However, careful planning and administration are crucial for its success.\n\nFor any organization facing similar challenges, a careful evaluation of the options (including in-house development) is crucial. Factors to consider include:\n\n*   **Available Engineering Resources:** If resources are scarce, a low-code/no-code platform like Appsmith can be a more efficient option.\n*   **Complexity of Requirements:** For highly specialized or complex needs, in-house development might be necessary.\n*   **Budget:** Consider both upfront development costs and ongoing maintenance costs.\n*   **Speed of Implementation:** How quickly does the solution need to be deployed?\n\nBy carefully weighing these factors, organizations can choose the best solution for their specific needs.\n\n\n---\n\nOkay, based on the provided information and analysis, here's a table summarizing the options for Project Falcon, prioritizing the \"in-house\" options, along with their pros and cons:\n\n**Project Falcon Service Options Analysis**\n\n| Service Name                      | Cost (Per User/Agent/Month) | Requirements Match Score (Out of 10) | Pros                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Cons                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **In-House Options**              |                               |                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ServiceNow IT Service Management  | $100.00                      | 9                                     | Comprehensive ITSM suite;

However, due to the high cost, it's important to start small and scale if the initial needs are met.\n\nBefore making a final decision, it is crucial to:\n\n*   **Conduct a thorough evaluation of each service's integration capabilities with existing HR and other internal systems.**\n*   **Assess the customization capabilities of each service to ensure it can meet the specific routing rules and reporting requirements of Project Falcon.**\n*   **Verify the scalability limits and pricing tiers of each service.**\n*   **Confirm compatibility with the organization's existing authentication method.**\n*   **Ensure the service can meet the data retention requirements and any specific legal or regulatory mandates.**\n\nA pilot program with a limited feature set could be implemented to test the chosen service's functionality and gather feedback before a full-scale rollout.\n\n\n---\n\nOkay, based on the provided analysis, here's a table summarizing the potential \"in-house\" service options for Project Falcon, along with their pros, cons, and a recommendation.\n\n**Project Falcon: In-House Service Options Analysis**\n\n| Service Name                                      | Estimated Cost  | Match Score (Out of 10) | Pros                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Cons                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **In-House Options (Priority)**                  |                 |                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Enterprise Service Desk Platform                  | $10,000 - $25,000 | 8                       | Addresses a broad range of functional requirements (Unified Intake Portal, Authentication, Request Submission, Basic Routing, Request Tracking, Administrator Dashboard, Search Functionality, Escalation, Notification).

However, significant effort will be required to integrate these services, particularly the Service Desk Platform with SAP via the iPaaS.  **A thorough assessment of the Enterprise Service Desk platform and iPaaS capabilities is crucial before proceeding.**\n\n**Key Recommendations for Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Clarify Open Questions (OQ.01 - OQ.08):** These answers are critical for accurate service selection and cost estimation. Specifically, the technology stack (Power Platform vs. ServiceNow) will significantly influence the integration approach and costs.\n2.  **Detailed Cost Assessment:** Obtain more precise cost estimates from the relevant internal service owners, considering the specific requirements of Project Falcon.\n3.  **Integration Planning:** Develop a detailed integration plan, focusing on the Service Desk Platform, iPaaS, Reporting and Analytics, and Notification Services.\n4.  **Budget Review:** Compare the total estimated cost of leveraging these in-house services with the overall budget (NFR.15). Identify potential areas for scope reduction or cost optimization.\n5.  **Data Residency Verification:** Confirm that all selected services meet the Canadian data residency requirements (NFR.14).\n6.  **Pilot Program Planning:** Ensure that the selected services can adequately support the Facilities team and staff during the pilot phase (FR.14).\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, the project team can make informed decisions about leveraging existing in-house services to achieve Project Falcon's objectives within budget and on schedule.\n\n\n---\n\nOkay, here's a table summarizing the

I’ll break it into multiple parts and  continue posting until we reach ~10,000 words.            Project Falcon Kickoff Meeting Transcript    Date:   July 15, 2025  Attendees:    •     Sarah (Project Sponsor)    •     Jamal (Product Owner)    •     Priya (IT Lead)    •     Daniel (Operations Manager)    •     Olivia (Communications Lead)    •     Todd (Finance)    •     Elena (Privacy Officer)    •     Brian (Procurement)    •     Marco (HR Analyst)    •     Judy (Accessibility Consultant)          PART 1    Sarah:   Okay, thanks everyone for making the time today. I know this has been a long time  coming, but we’re officially kicking off Project Falcon. We’ve had complaints for over a year  about how scattered and inefficient our internal service request processes are.   Employees  don’t know where to go. One day they’re emailing Facilities, the next they’re submitting a  form for IT. It’s duplicative, slow, and causing frustration.    Jamal:   Totally agree. In fact, I gathered some feedback from different departments last  quarter, and it’s clear we’ve got at least seven separate intake mechanisms across four  different divisions. Some of them are forms, some are shared inboxes, and some are jus t  verbal requests or Teams messages.    Priya:   It’s worse in IT. We’ve been routing requests manually for years. There’s no  centralized system. Everything is ad hoc. People submit tickets through a form we made in\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    2018. It’s not integrated with anything. We tried automating a few things with Power  Automate, but it broke when we updated our SharePoint environment.    Daniel:   And Facilities isn’t any better. People submit requests for ergonomic chairs,  electrical repairs, or even new furniture layouts   —   all through Excel spreadsheets emailed  around. And there’s no tracking. If someone doesn’t reply, the request just disappears .    Olivia:   That’s a huge communications problem too. People assume their request is being  worked on, but unless someone manually confirms, there’s zero visibility.    Sarah:   That’s exactly why we need a unified intake portal. Not a complete rebuild, but  something layered on top of what we already have. I want to avoid a costly custom solution  if we can.    Todd:   Budget is a big constraint. Right now, we’ve set aside $150,000 total. That’s to cover  everything   —   licensing, tech configuration, user training, change management, maybe a few  contractors if needed. If we go over that, I’ll need to go back to Finance and   justify every  cent.    Brian:   Also, any vendor engagements or tool purchases above $50K need to go through  Procurement. That includes software customizations if they require external work.    Judy:   I just want to flag this now   —   whatever we build must be compliant with accessibility  standards. WCAG 2.2 AA is the bare minimum. That means keyboard navigation, screen  reader compatibility, and ensuring color contrast ratios are respected.    Marco:   One of the things HR has been struggling with is onboarding. Right now, we have a  separate form for each of the following: provisioning equipment, payroll setup, ID card  access, and orientation. The same information   —   name, start date, employee ID   —   is  en tered into each. If we could unify that intake at least for onboarding, that would save tons  of admin time.    Priya:   I like the idea of a unified form, but we’ll need logic in the form to route requests  appropriately. Provisioning a laptop is IT; setting up payroll is Finance. So we’d need  conditional fields and workflows that send the right bits of data to the right te ams.    Jamal:   We could probably do that with Power Apps and Power Automate. The bigger  question is   —   do we use that stack, or do we build this on ServiceNow? Some departments  are already using ServiceNow for ticketing.    Sarah:   Let’s list pros and cons. ServiceNow is robust, but expensive to customize and slow  to update. Power Platform is cheaper and already covered by our M365 licenses, but it’s not  great for scaling.    Daniel:   And what about SAP? Some of the requests we receive   —   especially HR ones   —  touch SAP. Like, if someone’s requesting time off or a salary advance, that’s all in SAP.\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    Priya:   Yes, we’d need an API layer. We can’t just pull data from SAP directly without  authorizations. And those APIs aren’t free.    Elena:   And speaking of time off   —   let’s be mindful of privacy implications. If someone’s  requesting an ergonomic chair due to a disability, or needs accommodation for health  reasons, we’re dealing with personal health information. We’ll need consent capture and  data retention protocols.    Sarah:   Absolutely. Elena, can you own that piece? Make sure whatever solution we build  passes our privacy assessments?    Elena:   Will do. And just a heads - up   —   we’ll probably need a PIA (Privacy Impact  Assessment) even if we’re using existing tools. It’s the flow of data that matters, not just the  tools.    Jamal:   Can we include consent checkboxes in the intake form? Something like: “I consent to  the collection of personal health information for the purposes of accommodation”?    Elena:   Yes, but it needs to be customizable. We don’t want to show that prompt to someone  just requesting a standing desk.    Priya:   We can build conditional logic to show consent fields based on request type.    Marco:   Are we going to need user authentication? Like, can anyone submit a request or only  authenticated staff?    Sarah:   Only authenticated staff. We don’t want anonymous submissions. Also, auditability is  key   —   we need a log of who submitted what, when, and where it went.    Priya:   ServiceNow does that automatically. Power Platform can do it, but we’ll have to  configure it.    Todd:   We’ll need metrics. How many requests are submitted each month? What categories?  Average turnaround times? We should baseline current metrics before we start so we can  compare.    Daniel:   If we don’t reduce duplicate submissions, the whole thing will be a waste. We get  the same request sent three different ways just because people don’t know if it worked the  first time.    Olivia:   That’s a messaging issue. We need to be clear: this is the   one   place to go. And we  need to train people on how to use it. Not just instructions   —   real change management.    Sarah:   Okay. Here’s what I’m thinking:    •     Jamal: Own the backlog, intake mapping, and service catalog    •     Priya: Lead tech feasibility, integration planning, and MVP design\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    •     Olivia: Comms, training, stakeholder engagement    •     Elena: Privacy compliance and consent protocols    •     Judy: Accessibility compliance    •     Marco: HR - specific process redesign    •     Daniel: Pilot and Facilities pain points    •     Todd: Budget tracking and financial controls    •     Brian: Procurement thresholds and vendor onboarding    Brian:   What’s the timeline?    Sarah:   I want a pilot with Facilities live by November. That gives us about four months to  define the MVP, build it, and test. We’ll scale in Q1 next year.    Jamal:   Do we include Facilities only in the MVP?    Sarah:   Yes. That keeps it focused. We’ll layer in HR and IT after the pilot.    Priya:   Just thinking ahead   —   if we start with Facilities, we’ll need to define the service  categories they handle. Right now, we’ve got building access, maintenance, space planning,  health and safety requests, and a few others. Some of those overlap with other d epartments,  especially for ergonomic equipment.    Daniel:   Yeah, and some requests go to multiple teams. Like if someone requests a new  workspace layout, it touches Facilities, IT (for wiring), and HR (if it’s due to an  accommodation). How are we going to triage those?    Jamal:   We’ll need a triage engine   —   maybe even something rules - based at first. Like: if the  request type is “workspace change” AND it mentions “ergonomics,” route it to HR and  Facilities. We could build a keyword - trigger system in the first phase.    Sarah:   That’s fine for MVP. We’re not solving all automation up front   —   just simplifying the  front door and building basic routing.    Judy:   We should also add a way for users to track the status of their requests. If they submit  something and don’t hear back, they assume it got lost.    Marco:   Exactly. If we could at least show “Request received,” “In progress,” “Closed,” that  would reduce a lot of email follow - up.    Priya:   Power Automate could do that with approval flows. We’d just need to make sure  status is visible to the requester.\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    Todd:   Don’t overcomplicate it though. If we spend too much time designing a dashboard for  status updates, we’ll blow half the budget.    Brian:   Also, let’s make sure that if we use external resources   —   consultants or devs   —   we  bake in handover documentation. I don’t want to be stuck with something no one knows  how to maintain six months from now.    Elena:   Can we also talk data retention? If someone submits a request with personal details,  how long are we storing that data? What’s the retention policy?    Priya:   That depends on the type of request. Some things can be deleted after closure, others  may need to be retained for audit or legal reasons.    Sarah:   Let’s err on the side of caution and set a default retention of 6 months post - closure  unless otherwise required. Elena, can you draft a policy?    Elena:   Sure. I’ll check with Legal too.    Olivia:   From a change perspective   —   we need to soft - launch the portal with a friendly  message. I’d suggest branding it something neutral, not too bureaucratic. “OneStop” or  “MyRequest Hub” or something approachable.    Jamal:   What about “Falcon Portal”? Stay on - brand?    Olivia:   Maybe for internal team discussions, but for end - users we want clarity over cool  names.    Sarah:   Let’s decide on branding next week. Right now, I need MVP requirements scoped out  clearly. What do we need to deliver for the pilot?    Jamal:   Off the top of my head:    1.     A front - end request form   —   dynamic, with conditional logic    2.     User authentication (GoA SSO)    3.     Routing logic based on request type    4.     Confirmation email or message upon submission    5.     Status tracking view for the user    6.     Audit trail for internal teams    7.     Service catalog reference    8.     Privacy consent field (conditional)    9.     WCAG 2.2 AA compliant design\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    10.     Mobile responsiveness    11.     Retention policy applied    12.     Feedback form or rating post - closure    Daniel:   Can we do all that in four months?    Priya:   Technically, yes, but we’ll need some dev help. I’ll map dependencies this week.    Brian:   If there’s a risk of vendor involvement, loop me in immediately.    Sarah:   Agreed. I want zero surprises on procurement.    Marco:   We also need some kind of FAQ or knowledge base. People still submit tickets for  stuff they can do themselves, like “How do I reset my password?”    Jamal:   That’s a phase two thing. Let’s not let scope creep kill phase one.    Judy:   Don’t forget localization. Are we offering French at launch?    Sarah:   I checked   —   not mandatory for MVP. But whatever we build must be translation -  ready.    Todd:   And we should track user adoption metrics. If 80% of Facilities requests are still  coming in by email after we launch, we’ve failed.    Priya:   That means blocking off old channels at some point. Maybe not day one, but within  60 days.    Olivia:   Let’s draft a comms plan that includes:    •     What’s changing    •     Why we’re doing this    •     What users need to do    •     Where they can get help    I’ll do the first draft this week.    Sarah:   Thank you. Let’s aim for our next checkpoint in 10 business days. I want:    •     MVP requirements finalized    •     Tech options narrowed to two paths    •     First draft of comms plan    •     Budget breakdown by component\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    •     Risk register (high - level only)    •     Pilot plan draft with Facilities    Priya:   Can we include architecture diagrams too? Helps when evaluating tools.    Sarah:   Absolutely. Priya, you and Jamal can tag - team that.    Jamal:   Just before we wrap today   —   do we want to include escalation paths in the MVP?  Like, if someone submits a request and it hasn’t been addressed in three days, it pings a  manager?    Daniel:   That would be super helpful. Our teams often miss emails when they’re swamped. A  simple rule like \"escalate after 72 hours of no status update\" would prevent a lot of rework.    Priya:   We can do that with Power Automate or in ServiceNow workflows. I just need to  know the SLA windows per category.    Sarah:   Okay, let’s define that. Can each department lead provide estimated response times  for their top 5 request types?    Marco:   Sure, but I’ll warn you now   —   for HR, onboarding requests need 3 – 5 business days,  but access card setup takes 1 – 2 days. It varies a lot.    Brian:   Then maybe instead of hardcoded SLAs, we use tiering   —   like low, medium, high  priority. That way we have flexibility.    Jamal:   Makes sense. We’ll define tiers and assign target response times by tier. But we’ll  also need fallback owners. If a team doesn’t act, who picks it up?    Daniel:   In Facilities, we have zone supervisors. We can use them as fallback for escalations.    Olivia:   Let’s communicate that clearly to users. If you submit something and it’s not  touched within X days, we’ll follow up. That builds trust.    Sarah:   Add that to the comms doc, Olivia.    Olivia:   Already done.    Todd:   Okay, about that budget. I’ve started breaking it down. Here's a rough sketch:    •     $40K for potential ServiceNow consulting (if we go that route)    •     $20K for training and change management materials    •     $10K for temporary staff to manage intake volume during pilot    •     $30K reserved for dev contractors if Power Platform isn’t sufficient    •     $15K buffer for licensing surprises or contingency\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    •     $35K for privacy review, accessibility audit, and legal consulting    Leaves us with zero flexibility, just FYI.    Sarah:   That means we can’t afford scope creep. Everyone   —   if it’s not needed for MVP, it’s  out.    Judy:   Can we plan an accessibility audit   before   the pilot goes live? That way we’re not  scrambling after we’ve launched.    Priya:   Yes, we’ll do a walkthrough in staging first, Judy. I’ll loop you in two weeks before  pilot.    Brian:   Same with procurement thresholds   —   if we decide on tools or licenses and they  cross that $50K line, we’ll need an RFP, or at least a sourcing strategy.    Sarah:   Can you draft a one - pager with all thresholds and approvals, Brian?    Brian:   Will do.    Elena:   Also flagging that if we’re sending any data to external tools or vendors, we need a  DPIA. And any system collecting PHI or SIN must be hosted in Canada.    Priya:   Both ServiceNow and Microsoft environments are compliant, but I’ll double - check  data residency for Power Automate connectors.    Sarah:   Thanks. Let’s not assume   —   let’s confirm.    Marco:   Do we want to log all user actions? Like who submitted, who approved, who viewed  the request?    Priya:   If we’re building it ourselves, yes. That’s part of the audit log. Power Platform and  ServiceNow both allow that.    Todd:   And retention?    Elena:   As mentioned, 6 months post - closure is our default unless Finance, Legal, or Union  policies require more. I’ll document exceptions.    Daniel:   I have another point. During the pilot, should we run dual entry? Like, keep the old  Excel + email process running while piloting the portal?    Sarah:   Maybe for the first 2 weeks, but that can create noise. We’ll do dual entry   only   for  critical services. Otherwise, we ask people to use the new system.    Olivia:   We’ll need heavy communications in the first few days. Maybe even pop - ups in  Teams or a banner in SharePoint.    Priya:   I can ask our M365 admin to put a news post on the intranet with a link and FAQ.\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    Sarah:   Good. Everyone   —   make a note: we will   not   go live quietly. We will  overcommunicate.    Jamal:   Do we want feedback during the pilot?    Sarah:   Absolutely. Anonymous if possible. Olivia?    Olivia:   I’ll embed a feedback form link in the confirmation email after every request. Keep it  short   —   three questions max.    Judy:   Include an accessibility comment box too. Let’s collect issues proactively.    Sarah:   Excellent.    Marco:   Also, when we present this to the steering committee, let’s frame it not as a tech  upgrade but as a   workforce efficiency initiative . That’s what they care about.    Todd:   I second that. Don’t lead with “Power Automate” or “ServiceNow.” Lead with “less  frustration, more time saved.”    Olivia:   I’ll tailor the narrative. I’ll use staff quotes from Jamal’s intake interviews too   —  humanize the pain.    Jamal:   I’ve got some great ones. “I emailed Facilities and never heard back. Then I called.  Then I filled a form. Still no response.” That kind of thing.    Sarah:   Perfect. Let’s hit them with reality. Okay team   —   anything else?    Daniel:   I’ll send over our top 10 most common Facilities requests by tomorrow. And I’ll  include average handling time too.    Marco:   I’ll map out the onboarding workflows and forms we currently use. I might need  help untangling who owns what.    Sarah:   Good. Olivia, create a shared OneDrive folder for all artifacts. Name it “Falcon  Working Docs” and send out access.    Olivia:   Will do.    Sarah:   Okay, next full - team checkpoint is in 10 business days. Jamal and Priya, I’ll see you  sooner for a technical deep dive. Great work everyone.    Sarah:   Thanks for coming back together so quickly, everyone. This working session is to get  into the weeds   —   let’s start with the intake form design. Jamal, you had a first draft?    Jamal:   Yeah. I mocked up a basic intake form. It has fields for:    •     Request type    •     Department\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    •     Description    •     Urgency    •     Preferred response channel    •     Attachments    •     Consent checkboxes (conditional)    But it’s too generic right now. We need to tailor it based on the department selected.    Priya:   We can do that with conditional sections. For example, if someone selects “Facilities,”  we show questions about room numbers, asset IDs, etc. For “HR,” we show options for  onboarding, leave, etc.    Marco:   I’d prefer we don’t ask for the same info multiple times. HR is notorious for  duplicated fields   —   employee ID shows up in every form.    Daniel:   Same with Facilities. “What’s your floor and building?” is asked in three places.    Jamal:   So can we pull department, location, and employee ID automatically from the user’s  login?    Priya:   If we’re using Power Apps, yes   —   we can connect to Azure AD and prefill those fields.    Judy:   Just make sure we allow overrides. For example, someone might be submitting a  request for a colleague, like a manager requesting a chair for their employee.    Elena:   Yes, and when we allow proxy submissions, we need to log who submitted it and on  behalf of whom. That becomes part of the audit trail.    Brian:   Do we need manager approval flows?    Marco:   For HR, yes   —   especially for salary adjustments or training requests.    Priya:   That adds complexity. We’ll need to define business rules for each department   —  which request types need approvals, and who approves them.    Sarah:   Start with three departments: HR, Facilities, and IT. Map out which requests require  approvals, and from whom. Jamal, can you gather that?    Jamal:   Yep   —   I’ll schedule 30 - minute working sessions with each department.    Todd:   Also, if approvals slow things down, people will avoid the system. Just flagging that  risk.    Daniel:   Maybe we timebox approvals? Like if no one approves in 48 hours, it escalates?    Priya:   That’s doable. But who does it escalate to?\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    Brian:   Depends on org structure. We’ll need a fallback approval path defined by each team.    Jamal:   I’ll add that to my discovery doc.    Olivia:   From a messaging standpoint, we need to be careful about how we present  “approval.” Some staff might interpret it as micromanagement.    Sarah:   That’s why we need to sell this as empowerment. You’ll have more transparency, not  more red tape.    Judy:   Can we also talk interface layout? If we overload the first screen with 12 fields, people  will bail.    Priya:   We’ll use progressive disclosure. Start simple   —   show the basics, then reveal more  based on the answers.    Marco:   Also   —   tooltips. Some people don’t know what “service request category” means.  Keep language user - friendly.    Olivia:   Agree. I’ll do a copywriting pass once the fields are locked. Plain language only.    Elena:   And privacy disclosures   —   we can’t hide those behind tooltips. They need to be  prominent and in full.    Sarah:   Fair. Show consent language in full when needed. Maybe use a collapsible “Why we  ask this” link for context.    Daniel:   Can I suggest we include a “Request for someone else” checkbox at the top? That  alone clears up half of our confusion.    Jamal:   Noted. Will add.    Priya:   And on the backend, we should tag all requests with metadata: submitter,  department, timestamp, priority level, request type.    Todd:   That’ll help us with reporting. Eventually we’ll want to show things like average  resolution time per department.    Jamal:   Do we want dashboards at launch?    Sarah:   Not for the MVP. Just exportable reports. Dashboards are phase two.    Priya:   I’ll set up basic Power BI connectors in the background anyway, so we’re ready.    Brian:   Speaking of backend   —   do we need a database, or is SharePoint enough?    Priya:   Depends on scale. SharePoint lists can handle a pilot, but if we expand org - wide, we’ll  need Dataverse or Azure SQL.    Sarah:   Let’s plan for growth but don’t overengineer.\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    Daniel:   And what about notifications? Right now, people get no acknowledgment that their  request went anywhere.    Olivia:   We’ll send an automated email right after submission. “Thanks, your request has  been received.”    Priya:   We can also add Teams notifications for status changes if they opt in.    Jamal:   We should include an unsubscribe option   —   or at least a toggle.    Sarah:   Yes, and make sure it's one - way comms only. No replying to automated emails.    Elena:   Also make sure those emails don’t contain any personal data. Keep it generic.    Sarah:   Okay, we’re making progress. Jamal, you’ll update the intake form mockup. Priya,  explore prefill options. Olivia, start drafting plain - language copy.    Priya:   I’ll also schedule a technical working group for next week. We’ll prototype three key  flows and test data binding.    Brian:   Can I sit in? I’d like to see how complex the licensing model gets.    Priya:   Of course.    Sarah:   Let’s focus now on the pilot. We said Facilities would go first, but we need to define  the boundaries. What exactly is in scope for the pilot?    Daniel:   I’d suggest we start with four request types: maintenance issues, ergonomic  equipment requests, space changes, and new furniture setups. These are the most common,  and they all follow slightly different workflows   —   good stress test for the intake logic.    Jamal:   Okay, and are those already tracked in a spreadsheet or…?    Daniel:   Yep. We have an Excel file on a shared drive, updated weekly. Totally manual. And  there’s a column for “status,” but it’s often blank.    Priya:   We’ll migrate the last 30 days of requests for reference, then start fresh in the new  system.    Sarah:   No legacy data migration beyond 30 days. We’re not overloading MVP with cleanup  work.    Todd:   Smart. Every hour spent wrangling legacy data is one we don’t spend building.    Judy:   One thing I want to note about ergonomic equipment requests   —   they sometimes  come in via Occupational Health. If we don’t clarify the intake route, we’ll get duplicates.    Daniel:   We can coordinate that. I’ll send a note to the OH team and ask them to pause their  form during the pilot.\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    Olivia:   And I’ll create a redirect banner on their SharePoint site   —   “Submit ergonomic  requests here”   —   pointing to the Falcon form.    Sarah:   Excellent. Okay, what about approvers for those four Facilities requests?    Daniel:   For space changes and furniture, our Facilities Supervisor approves. For ergonomic  requests, it's usually HR or a health advisor. That’s where it gets murky.    Marco:   I’ll work with Daniel and HR to create an approval matrix   —   what triggers it, who  approves, fallback roles.    Jamal:   I’ll build that logic into the intake prototype.    Priya:   Let’s also include “Expected Response Time” in the request confirmation. Set  expectations right away.    Olivia:   Do we want “business days” or “calendar days” language?    Sarah:   Business days. Calendar time introduces weekend expectations, which we can’t  meet.    Elena:   Also, we need to put a disclaimer. Something like “Complex or multi - departmental  requests may require additional processing time.”    Jamal:   I’ll include a dynamic section that appears only for multi - path requests.    Daniel:   Are we doing any training for Facilities staff before the pilot?    Sarah:   Yes   —   Olivia?    Olivia:   Yep. We’ll do a 30 - minute live Teams session, recorded for later. I’ll also build a 1 -  page quick reference guide. Just enough to get them started.    Brian:   And do we have a process if someone refuses to use the new system?    Daniel:   Happens all the time. Some folks still prefer calling. I’ll give them 2 weeks of grace,  then stop accepting verbal requests unless it’s an emergency.    Sarah:   Good. Let’s communicate that upfront, kindly. “During the pilot, we’re asking all staff  to use the new request portal. This helps us test and improve.”    Olivia:   Perfect. That’ll go into the announcement.    Judy:   Do we have a feedback loop built into the pilot?    Jamal:   Yes. Every submission will trigger a confirmation message with a link to a 3 - question  feedback form. Optional but encouraged.    Sarah:   What about internal resistance? Any departments already pushing back?\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    Jamal:   A few   —   Finance says they prefer email because it's “traceable.” Legal hasn’t  responded at all. And Security is concerned that electronic requests aren’t secure enough.    Elena:   We can address that. All submissions will be encrypted, routed over authenticated  GoA systems. No external transmission. I’ll draft a security overview.    Sarah:   Good. And Legal?    Priya:   I’ll follow up. If we frame this as a more auditable, trackable, compliant system,  they’ll likely come on board.    Marco:   And Finance? Honestly, email isn’t traceable   —   it’s informal. We should be  positioning this as   more accountable .    Todd:   Agreed. I’ll talk to my team. Some of them just hate change. Let me handle it  internally.    Sarah:   Thank you. Let’s maintain one voice, though   —   this isn’t optional. We’re moving  toward standardization.    Brian:   Once the pilot starts, will we have a daily standup?    Jamal:   Yes. I propose a 15 - minute daily standup for the first two weeks of the pilot. Report  on volume, failures, successes, bugs, and feedback.    Sarah:   Agreed. Jamal will lead that. Invite Priya, Olivia, Daniel, Judy, Elena. Optional for  others.    Priya:   I’ll also set up a shared Teams channel just for the pilot team.    Daniel:   And I’ll assign one Facilities team member as the Falcon “super user”   —   someone  who becomes the go - to internally.    Olivia:   Love that. Peer - to - peer support always works better than pushing things top - down.    Sarah:   Okay, next up   —   rollout risks. I want a short list of the biggest known risks, plus  mitigation steps. Let’s keep it practical.    Sarah:   Okay, let’s list out key risks before we wrap. Top five, preferably with mitigations.  Start us off?    Priya:   Sure   —  Risk 1 : Tool failure during pilot (Power Apps form crashes or flow errors).  Mitigation : Staging environment testing, daily monitoring, backup manual form if outage  exceeds 1 hour.    Jamal:  Risk 2 : Workflow misrouting (requests going to the wrong team or no team).\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    Mitigation : Validate routing logic with all stakeholders before go - live. Test with real - life  scenarios. Maintain a catch - all inbox during pilot.    Daniel:  Risk 3 : Staff ignore the new system, continue using old channels.  Mitigation : Pre - pilot comms campaign, visible redirection messages, senior leader  endorsement, and hard cutoff date for legacy systems.    Olivia:  Risk 4 : Poor user experience leads to negative perception.  Mitigation : Simple UX, plain language, progressive rollout. Collect feedback early and act on  it fast.    Elena:  Risk 5 : Privacy breach   —   request data shared or stored incorrectly.  Mitigation : Limit field visibility, strict permissions on storage, audit trail, data retention  policy enforced.    Sarah:   That’s good. Let’s add those to the risk register. Olivia, document these in the pilot  workbook.    Olivia:   On it.    Todd:   I’d add one more: budget overrun.  Mitigation : Weekly finance check - ins, prioritize features, delay non - MVP work until post -  pilot.    Sarah:   Perfect. Let’s make that Risk 6. I want all these shared with the Executive Committee  before we launch.    Brian:   Speaking of that   —   what’s our comms plan for senior leaders? We need buy - in  beyond this room.    Olivia:   I’m preparing a 1 - page briefing. Key points:    •     What the Falcon portal is    •     Why it matters    •     What the pilot includes    •     Early wins we’re targeting    •     KPIs we’ll track    I’ll avoid jargon. Use quotes, short stats. Make it story - driven.    Sarah:   Good. Make sure it includes: “This is the first step in a broader transformation of  internal services.” That’s the long game.\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    Jamal:   Also mention that this creates structure for cross - departmental collaboration. We’ve  never had a shared intake process before.    Olivia:   Got it. And I’ll frame it as reducing manual load and increasing traceability   —   that  resonates with execs.    Marco:   Should we mention AI?    Priya:   Not yet. It’ll confuse the narrative. We’re not there   —   yet.    Sarah:   Agree. Let’s stay grounded in the now. “Modernization” is a better word than  “automation” at this stage.    Elena:   For metrics   —   what are we actually measuring?    Jamal:    •     Number of requests submitted via portal    •     Completion rates    •     Average time to route    •     Feedback form submissions    •     Number of duplicate submissions avoided    •     Staff satisfaction score (post - pilot survey)    Sarah:   And we compare that to pre - pilot data?    Jamal:   Yes. I’m collecting baseline stats now. Daniel’s helping from Facilities.    Brian:   If we can show a 30 – 40% reduction in emails or resolution time, that’s a win.    Todd:   Plus the budget angle. Standardizing intake means we avoid building five different  intake systems. That’s real savings.    Sarah:   Make sure that’s in the executive one - pager. Real numbers, even rough estimates,  carry weight.    Olivia:   Will do.    Daniel:   Also   —   what’s the plan after the pilot? What if it works?    Sarah:   We do a phased rollout. Department by department. Probably HR next, then IT. But  only after full post - mortem.    Marco:   Can we start planning for HR already?\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    Sarah:   Yes, but quietly. Don’t distract from the Facilities pilot. Just prep in the background.    Jamal:   What’s the go/no - go criteria after the pilot?    Sarah:   Good question. Let’s define that now:    •     At least 80% of Facilities requests submitted through Falcon    •     90% routing accuracy    •     No critical bugs for five consecutive business days    •     Positive net feedback score    •     No unresolved privacy or accessibility issues    Priya:   That’s measurable. I’ll set up a dashboard in Power BI so we can track daily during  the pilot.    Brian:   Should we share that dashboard with execs?    Sarah:   Only after week 2. I don’t want them jumping to conclusions on day one.    Elena:   Agreed. Raw data early on is always messy.    Sarah:   Okay, next steps   —   everyone, check your assignments from last meeting and update  the shared workbook. We meet again next Wednesday for the final readiness review.    Olivia:   I’ll also prep the pilot launch deck in case we want to present it to the broader org.    Sarah:   Perfect. This is taking shape. We’re making real progress, team. Keep pushing.    Jamal:   Quick sidebar before we wrap   —   small issue popped up. I met with the Facilities  intake team yesterday, and apparently, they’ve been using a shadow SharePoint form we  didn’t even know about.    Priya:   Wait, what? Another one?    Daniel:   Ugh… yeah, I knew they had something, but I thought it was just for internal  tracking.    Jamal:   No, people from outside the department have access. It’s linked from the old intranet  page. It’s unprotected, unauthenticated, and   —   get this   —   it emails completed forms to one  admin.    Elena:   That’s a privacy issue.    Priya:   That’s a   disaster . How long has this been active?    Daniel:   I honestly don’t know. I assumed IT had shut it down already.\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    Brian:   This is exactly why we need central governance. Everyone builds tools in the wild,  and no one knows what exists.    Sarah:   Okay, first: disable the form   today . Priya, can you take that on?    Priya:   Yep. I’ll contact the site admin and get it taken offline.    Jamal:   Should we redirect it to Falcon?    Sarah:   Not yet. I don’t want to drive traffic to a pilot that isn’t live. Just kill it for now and  post a temporary message: “This form is being updated. Please contact Facilities directly.”    Olivia:   I’ll write the message in plain language. No finger - pointing.    Marco:   Do we need to log this somewhere? Like in the privacy tracker?    Elena:   Absolutely. We’ll list it as a legacy form decommissioned due to privacy risk. I’ll  include it in our pilot PIA under mitigation steps.    Sarah:   Add that to the “lessons learned” list. We’re going to find more of these skeleton  tools. That’s part of why we’re doing Falcon in the first place.    Todd:   Can we also build a checklist of what other legacy forms or tools we need to audit?  Like a quick scan?    Priya:   I’ll create a tracker. We’ll start with what departments self - report, then dig deeper as  needed.    Brian:   Just be careful   —   this can turn into a monster project if we’re not scoped properly.    Sarah:   True. Let’s focus just on forms related to service requests. Don’t go looking in HR  policy libraries or IT backlogs.    Jamal:   One more thing   —   during my interview with Facilities staff, a few of them said they  don’t actually understand what happens after a request is submitted. They just mark it  “received” and assume someone else will handle it.    Daniel:   That’s… embarrassingly accurate.    Olivia:   That’s a training gap. People need to know what they’re responsible for once the  form hits their desk.    Sarah:   So let’s add workflow transparency to the MVP. When a request is routed to a team,  they see exactly what’s expected   —   “assign,” “complete,” “escalate.”    Priya:   We can embed a simple status dropdown in the request record: “Received,” “In  Progress,” “Waiting,” “Closed.”    Jamal:   And define what those mean. So there’s no ambiguity.\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    Marco:   Can we make that a dropdown with definitions in tooltips?    Judy:   Only if tooltips are screen reader accessible.    Priya:   Got it   —   we’ll make sure everything is labeled properly and exposed to assistive tech.    Sarah:   What’s the user - facing language? We don’t want to confuse people with backend  statuses.    Olivia:   I’ll draft a translation matrix   —   internal statuses vs. what users see. “Received”  might become “We’ve got your request.” “In Progress” might be “We’re working on it.”    Sarah:   Perfect. This is the kind of UX work that makes or breaks adoption.    Todd:   Any feedback yet from your beta testers?    Jamal:   Yeah, actually. A few said the confirmation email was too long. One person said, “I  didn’t read it because it looked like a newsletter.”    Olivia:   I’ll tighten it up. No more than two sentences, plus a link to track status or give  feedback.    Elena:   And make sure there’s no personally identifiable info in the email body. Just a  generic reference ID.    Daniel:   Do we want to generate ticket numbers?    Priya:   We can use a date + department code + sequence. Like FAL - 20250717 - OPS - 001.    Jamal:   Nice. It looks official, and it helps with referencing if someone calls for updates.    Sarah:   Good. Let’s test that with the pilot. We may want to mask it later if it becomes  confusing.    Sarah:   Thanks, everyone. This is our last readiness check before we launch the pilot next  Monday. Let’s walk through what’s done, what’s not, and anything that could derail us.    Jamal:   The intake form is locked. Final version includes conditional logic, authentication,  prefilled user data from Azure AD, a free - text description field, and consent checkboxes  where needed. The routing engine is wired to Facilities, HR, and IT for pilot req uests. We’ve  tested 19 scenarios so far.    Priya:   On the tech side, we’ve configured Power Automate flows to handle submissions,  trigger Teams notifications to assignees, and update SharePoint lists for tracking. We’ve also  added the audit log function Jamal requested   —   every action is timestamped and ass ociated  with a user ID.    Sarah:   Good. Any concerns?\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    Priya:   One   —   we’re seeing some latency when submitting large requests with attachments.  Not critical, but annoying.    Judy:   Attachments   —   are they accessible?    Priya:   Depends. If someone uploads a scanned image with no alt text, we can’t control that.  We’re not doing OCR yet.    Judy:   Let’s at least remind users to upload readable documents. Put a tip near the  attachment field.    Olivia:   Done. I’ll add: “Please upload readable files. Avoid images of text.”    Daniel:   Our Facilities team is trained. We did a full walkthrough yesterday. The “super  user” has also run three mock requests and provided feedback.    Sarah:   Any issues?    Daniel:   Mostly minor. People didn’t realize they had to click “Submit” twice   —   once after  previewing. That’s fixed now, right?    Jamal:   Yes. It’s now one - click. Preview is optional.    Marco:   I walked two HR staff through it. One loved it. The other asked, “Why can’t I just  email someone like I always do?”    Sarah:   (laughs) That’s the reaction we expect. Olivia   —   what’s the nudge plan?    Olivia:   A short, friendly email from department heads is going out tomorrow. Subject:  “We’re modernizing how you submit requests.” I’ve also prepared a 90 - second explainer  video and a clickable walkthrough GIF.    Elena:   Do we have DPIA signoff?    Priya:   Yes. Elena finalized it yesterday.    Elena:   The only caveat is: if we later add analytics that track behavioral patterns   —   like  how long someone takes to complete a form   —   we’ll need an amendment.    Sarah:   That’s phase 2. We’re safe for now.    Brian:   I ran a final procurement scan. No external vendors were used for development. No  thresholds were breached. You’re clear.    Todd:   Budget check: we’ve spent $92,350. That includes training, comms, design, and two  part - time contract resources. We’re under budget, but keep in mind that post - pilot work  hasn’t started yet.    Sarah:   Good. Let’s stay lean. Next   —   objections. Anyone raised red flags?\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    Jamal:   IT Security said they want to review the connector we’re using to route requests via  Teams. They didn’t say no   —   just that they weren’t looped in early enough.    Priya:   That’s on me. I’ll send them the flow diagram and metadata policy today.    Sarah:   Let me know if they escalate.    Olivia:   I got one comment from Legal: “What happens if someone uploads a complaint or  whistleblower - type issue?”    Elena:   We’re not handling that through Falcon. That should still go through the Ethics  Office.    Sarah:   Okay. Let’s clarify that in the FAQs. Falcon is for   operational service requests   only.    Marco:   What about general feedback or complaints? Should we ignore them?    Jamal:   We can accept them, tag them, and route them to comms or the right team. But we  need a way to identify tone   —   complaints are different than “request for toner.”    Priya:   I can add a category: “Feedback or Suggestion.” That triggers a manual review.    Sarah:   Let’s not turn this into a complaints portal. But we   do   want signals.    Daniel:   Can we add a field: “Would you like a response?” So we know whether to follow up  or not.    Olivia:   That’s a great idea. Optional checkbox.    Priya:   I’ll add it tonight.          Jamal:   Early user testing results   —   we ran a usability study with eight employees from  different departments. Here’s what we learned:    •     6 out of 8 said the interface was “clear” or “very clear”    •     2 said the wording on routing was “too technical”   —   we fixed that    •     5 asked for status updates after submission   —   now included    •     2 didn’t realize they could attach multiple files   —   we’ve clarified that    •     Everyone said they preferred this over email   if   they knew it worked    Sarah:   That’s promising. Let’s keep collecting this kind of feedback post - launch.    Elena:   Can we archive those usability results in the privacy file? They’re helpful for  compliance reviews.\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\nClassification: Protected A    Jamal:   Done.    Sarah:   Final check: does everyone feel comfortable with Monday’s pilot launch?    Priya:   Yes, if we don’t add anything else.    Judy:   As long as the label contrast passes.    Marco:   As long as we don’t announce HR is next   —   not yet.    Todd:   If anything breaks, I want it reported before end - of - day, not next week.    Sarah:   Agreed. Priya, Jamal   —   you own triage. Olivia   —   monitor feedback inbox. Daniel   —  monitor usage on the Facilities side. We’ll regroup daily for the first 10 business days.    Everyone:      Sarah:   Okay then   —   let’s do this. Falcon is live Monday. Congratulations, team.",
