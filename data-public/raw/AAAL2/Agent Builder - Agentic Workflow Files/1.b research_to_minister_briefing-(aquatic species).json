The movement of watercraft into Alberta is the highest risk of infecting our waters. Always Clean, Drain and Dry any equipment used in the water before moving between water-bodies t o prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species and whirling disease. Whirling disease has been detected in Alberta. Transferring fish, mud, or water between water-bodies can spread this untreatable disease. What is an Aquatic Invasive Species? It's a non-native species or disease that threatens the: Diversity or abundance of native species and the ecological health of infested waters Recreational, agricultural or commercial activities dependent on water in lakes, rivers, streams and canals Why are Aquatic Invasive Species a problem? Aquatic Invasive Species are a threat to the economy; especially agriculture, tourism and recreation. They destroy our natural lake ecosystems and fisheries. Managing the impacts of these species and diseases could cost millions of dollars each year. The species of greatest concern in Alberta currently are two mussels and one plant. Quagga Mussel and Zebra Mussel ( Webpage from Ontario's Invading Species Awareness Program) Eurasian Watermilfoil ( Alberta Invasive Species Council ) Does Alberta have Quagga or Zebra Mussels? Not yet, and let's keep it that way. Prevention is the most effective way to manage AIS. We currently have some infestations of lower risk aquatic invasive species that are being managed locally - purple loosestrife for example. Whirling Disease in Alberta Whirling disease is present in Alberta. Containment and prevention are the best response as there is no treatment for this disease. Myxobolus cerebralis is the parasite that affects salmonid fishes, such as trout, salmon and whitefish. Clinical symptoms of whirling disease include a blackened tail, sloped head, crooked tail and an abnormal whirl or tail-chasing behaviour. Infection by this parasite can lead to fish mortality. How are Aquatic Invasive Species and Whirling Disease spread? Invasive species and diseases are primarily spread through transportation of water-based vessels or gear moved from infected waters to unaffected areas. The movement of infected fish, water or sediment may also spread invasive species and whirling disease. Mussel infected lakes have been found in Manitoba (Lake Winnipeg), Utah, Southwest United States and Eastern North America. Boaters are discouraged from transporting boats from these areas. How can I prevent the spread of Aquatic Invasive Species and Whirling Disease? Clean, Drain and Dry your boat and all equipment used in the water before departing a site. Pull the Plug! It is illegal to transport your watercraft with the drain plug still in place. Remove the plug to ensure all standing water is drained. The microscopic spores of whirling disease, as well as the microscopic veligers of invasive mussels cannot be seen by the naked eye and will survive for days in a watercraft’s standing water. AIS like Quagga and Zebra Mussles can spread quickly and can live out of water for up to 30 days. Whirling disease spores can remain viable in water anywhere from 3 to 30 years. Learn to identify Aquatic Invasive Species . What is Alberta Parks doing to address this issue? Alberta Parks is collaborating with Alberta Environment and Protected Areas and other government and external agencies to ensure prepared response should an AIS be introduced into a Provincial waterbody. Providing AIS education and awareness to Alberta Parks visitors through posters and information cards at visitor services.

Explore pages in: Aquatic invasive species Overview Invasive mussels Invasive fish species Don’t Let It Loose Invasive aquatic plants Place of origin Quagga and zebra mussels originate from the Caspian and Black Sea regions in Eastern Europe. In 1986, zebra mussels were first discovered in Lake St. Clair (the Great Lakes). In 1989, quagga mussels were first discovered near Lake Erie. They were introduced through the discharge of ballast water from ships. Since then, invasive mussels have spread throughout the Great Lakes and many lakes in Ontario, Manitoba and the United States. Overland watercraft transport has been the main pathway of spread across Canada and the United States. To our knowledge, zebra or quagga mussels are currently not established in Alberta. For a map of confirmed locations, visit: USGS Zebra and Quagga Mussel Distribution Map Identifying quagga and zebra mussels Quagga and zebra mussels, which pose a significant threat to Alberta's aquatic ecosystems and economy, can be identified through key characteristics. Quagga mussel ( Dreissena rostriformis bugensis ) 1 to 5 cm, D-shaped shell Brown and yellow-white in colour, may have faint banding pattern Native to Ukraine, now found in various parts of North America, such as in the Colorado River system – a popular destination for Alberta snowbirds Live up to 5 years More adaptable than zebra mussels – can attach to softer substrates and survive in colder water. Zebra mussel ( Dreissena polymorpha ) 1 to 3 cm, triangular-shaped shell Brown and yellow-white in colour, usually with light-dark banding or zigzag pattern Native to Russia, now found in various parts of North America, such as in Lake Winnipeg and elsewhere in Manitoba.&nbsp; Invasive Species Hotline Do you think you've spotted a quagga or zebra mussel? Remember, an attached mussel is an invasive mussel, native mussels will be buried in the sand. Report it to Alberta's Invasive Species Hotline at 1-855-336-BOAT (2628). Similar species Caption 1: Alberta’s native mussels (bottom row) are larger (adults often over 7cm in length) and have an elongated oval shape. They are free-living and can be found buried or partially buried in the bottom of lakes and slow flowing rivers. In contrast, invasive mussels (top rows) are small, angular or D-shaped and attach themselves to substrates. Caption 2: Fingernail (also called pill and pea) clams are small free-living native clams (pictured on the left). Though some are similar in size to invasive mussels, native clams are more rounded and symmetrical than invasive mussels and have thin, often transparent shells that are easily crushed. Impacts of invasive mussels Environmental impacts Invasive mussels are filter feeders that strain suspended matter and food particles out of the water. Excessive feeding by large invasive mussel populations disrupt natural food chains. This results in a depleted fishery (fewer and smaller fish) as the fish don't have enough food. Impacts to infrastructure, recreation and economy Invasive mussels attach to hard substrates in the water, blanketing any surface and reproducing at extremely fast rates. Females can produce up to one million eggs every year, and there is no natural predator in Alberta.&nbsp; Dense cl\n\n\n---\n\n=== Aquatic Invasive Species ===\nAquatic Invasive Species Employment | Contact | FAQ &times; Home News/Ads About Departments Information Annual Reports Aquatic Invasive Species Board Meeting Minutes Board of Directors Elections Bylaws/Policy County of Newell Rural Water Project Funding Information Booklet Irrigation Districts Alberta Irrigation Districts Association Bow River Eastern Lethbridge Northern Raymond St. Mary River Taber United Western Maps/irma Newsletters Rehab Projects Scholarships Water Management Videos Recreation Public Access Guidelines Rolling Hills Reservoir Campground Crawling Valley Reservoir Campground Item 2 Item 3 EIDNet 2 item(s) $79.00 × 1 x $30 Winter Coat × 1 x $30 Sports Wear View Cart Checkout &times; Password Recovery To recover your password please fill in your email address Email Submit Back To Login Don't Have An Account Yet ?

Aquatic Invasive Species A threat to our environment. Home / ais EID Aquatic Invasive Species Prevention Program Aquatic invasive species (AIS) like zebra and quagga mussels pose a serious threat to Alberta’s water infrastructure, ecosystems, and economy. To help prevent their introduction into Alberta, the EID initiated an AIS Prevention Program in 2018. All watercraft users accessing EID reservoirs must follow approved prevention procedures and receive a new sticker each year prior to launching. Watercraft includes both motorized and non-motorized vessels such as kayaks, paddleboards, and canoes. Trailered watercraft are only permitted to launch from designated boat launches and must check-in before launching. Non-trailered watercraft (canoes, kayaks, paddleboards, etc.) may launch at other locations, but must still check-in before launching. Registration Locations: Crawling Valley Campground Kinbrook Island Provincial Park Boat Launch (when EID staff are present) Rolling Hills Reservoir Campground Lake Newell Resort Marina Failure to comply with AIS protocols may result in loss of access to EID lands and reservoirs. This program is supported by the County of Newell’s Boating Safety and Aquatic Invasive Species Bylaw (2001-21). Please remember to clean, drain, and dry your watercraft before moving to a new waterbody. Do not release garden plants or pets into the wild. Click here to download the AIS Quick Fact Card . Please see below for information on Aquatic Invasive Species. Aquatic Invasive Species: Information Aquatic Invasive Species: View Species Details × Aquatic Invasive Species: Details Zebra and Quagga Mussels Zebra and Quagga mussels are freshwater mussels, native to Eastern Europe that can permanently attach to any hard surface including docks, watercraft, rocks, water conveyance intakes, pipelines, previous generations of adult mussels, and even grains of sand. They are prolific reproducers with female mussels releasing up to one million eggs per year into the water column. Zebra and Quagga mussels are very small, usually growing between 1-3 cm long, filter feeding on microscopic organisms and disrupting the food chain for native fish and invertebrate species. Adult mussels can survive up to 30 days out water, given the right temperature and humidity levels, and the microscopic larvae of mussels (veligers) can survive within water in bilges and live wells for a number of days. Zebra and Quagga mussels can be found throughout the Great Lakes, Lake Winnipeg, and the Mississippi River watershed. A Zebra or Quagga mussel infestation in Alberta is estimated to cost over $75 million annually and can cause millions of dollars in damage to water-operated infrastructure, disrupt natural food chains, create toxic algal blooms, decrease property values, and hinder recreational activities. Flowering Rush Flowering rush is a cat-tail like perennial plant which thrives in moist areas on the edge of water bodies or submerged in deeper water. It is able to reproduce by seed and vegetatively through rhizomatous bulblets which separate from parent plants. Once established it forms dense mats of vegetation choking out native vegetation and disrupting fish and wildlife habitat. It was likely introduced into Alberta as an ornamental garden plant. Flowering Rush is extremely difficult to control. Cutting and hand digging is feasible with small populations, however attempts must be made to remove all of the plant as any small piece of root fragment has the potential to regrow and start a new infestation. Cutting and hand digging must be ongoing until all traces of the plant is removed and regrowth does not appear which is usually very difficult to achieve. There is currently no chemical control measures to eradicate this invasive plant due to its growth within a\n\n\n---\n\n=== An estimate of annual economic cost of invasive dreissenid mussels to Alberta - Open Government ===\nAn estimate of annual economic cost of invasive dreissenid mussels to Alberta - Open Government Skip to content Resources Interact Open Data Publications Documentation Apps Visualizations Blog Suggest a Resource Contact For Developers Web Usage Metrics Home Open Government Publications Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email RSS Publications An estimate of annual economic cost of invasive dreissenid mussels to Alberta Summary Detailed Information Related (0) Description Evidence from jurisdictions elsewhere shows that the annual cost of managing the effects of invasive Dreissenid mussel species (quagga and zebra) are significant.

Conservation Officer Service (COS) has a team of specialized inspectors checking and, if necessary, decontaminating watercraft being transported into B.C. Inspectors are trained in watercraft inspection and decontamination following the standard protocol that is used across the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp;All watercraft owners coming through watercraft inspection stations are asked a series of questions by the inspectors to determine if the watercraft is high or low risk.&nbsp;Two key questions asked by inspectors to determine watercraft risk are: Where was the watercraft in the last 30 days?&nbsp; How long has the watercraft been out of the water?&nbsp; Any watercraft or equipment that has been launched in any waters of a province or state known or suspected of having zebra, quagga or golden mussels in the past 30 days is considered high-risk. Any watercraft or equipment that is coming from or is registered to a state or province that is known or suspected of having&nbsp;zebra, quagga or golden mussels and is not clean, and to the extent determined as practical by inspectors has not been drained and dried is considered high-risk, even if it has been out of the water for over 30 days. Any watercraft that is dirty, crusty or slimy with the potential risk of transporting other aquatic invasive species is considered high-risk. Watercraft that have only been used within B.C. or other non-contaminated provinces or states within the last 30 days and are found to be clean, drain, dry and free of mud, debris, plants or any other AIS are considered low-risk. Learn more about bringing your boat from outside B.C. Fines for failing to stop It&rsquo;s mandatory to stop at any open watercraft inspection station along your travel route when transporting a boat in B.C. Failure to stop at an open inspection station could result in a fine of $690.&nbsp;Watercraft includes sailboats, motorboats, car toppers, kayaks, canoes, and paddle boards (including inflatables)&nbsp;being transported in B.C. 2025&nbsp;watercraft inspection season B.C. watercraft inspection stations (consult&nbsp;map below) opened in early April, 2025&nbsp;to mark the start of the 2025&nbsp;season. Most stations will be operational until late October.&nbsp; The 2025&nbsp;inspection station locations and hours of operation were selected using data collected from past seasons and lessons learned from other jurisdictions across western Canada and the United States. The locations are assessed for suitability&nbsp;based on: Volume of boater traffic Public and staff safety and communication Direction of traffic targeted Number of high-risk and mussel infested watercraft intercepted Image above provides examples of inspection station signs. Failure to stop at an inspection station can result in a $690 fine.&nbsp; This map provides the locations for 2025 Watercraft Inspection Stations. Light blue&nbsp;indicates permanent stations, yellow indicates part-time stations, and purple indicates roving inspection crews. For further questions or clarification about inspection station locations, contact: COS.Aquatic.Invasive.Species@gov.bc.ca B.C. - Alberta Passport Program&nbsp; In 2017 B.C. and Alberta launched a joint watercraft passport program. The passport is available for boaters who travel between B.C. and Alberta and those who only travel within B.C.&nbsp;Boaters can voluntarily sign up for a passport at any provincial watercraft inspection station. Provincial inspectors will ask the boater a series of questions to determine if they qualify for a passport. &nbsp;When passports are issued, boaters will be asked to sign a commitment to practice Clean, Drain, Dry and stop at all inspection stations.

The province's strategy is heavily focused on prevention, primarily through watercraft inspection and public education.  Key actions include:\n\n*   Mandatory watercraft inspections, especially for vessels entering Alberta from higher-risk areas.\n*   \"Clean, Drain, Dry\" initiatives to educate boaters and the public on preventing AIS spread.\n*   Collaboration between Alberta Parks, Alberta Environment and Protected Areas, and other agencies.\n*   Monitoring and rapid response planning in case of introduction.\n*   Economic impact assessments to justify prevention efforts.\n\n**Key Information for the Minister**\n\n1.  **The Threat:**\n    *   Quagga and zebra mussels are not native to Alberta and pose a serious threat to Alberta's water infrastructure, ecosystems, and economy.\n    *   They are highly invasive, reproduce rapidly, and can cause significant damage by:\n        *   Disrupting aquatic food chains, leading to depleted fisheries.\n        *   Clogging water infrastructure (e.g., irrigation canals, power plants), resulting in costly repairs and maintenance.\n        *   Impacting recreational activities and tourism.\n        *   Decreasing property values.\n    *   An infestation in Alberta is estimated to cost over $75 million annually.\n    *   These mussels filter feed excessively, potentially leading to toxic algal blooms.\n\n2.  **Prevention is the Priority:**\n    *   Alberta's primary strategy is to prevent the introduction of these mussels, as eradication is extremely difficult and costly once they become established.\n    *   Prevention efforts are considered more cost-effective than managing an infestation.\n\n3.  **Key Prevention Measures:**\n    *   **Watercraft Inspections:**\n        *   Mandatory inspections are in place, particularly focusing on watercraft entering Alberta from provinces and states where quagga and zebra mussels are present (e.g., Manitoba, Ontario, southwestern United States).\n        *   Inspectors assess the risk level of watercraft based on their origin and cleanliness.\n        *   Watercraft owners are asked about the watercraft's location in the last 30 days and how long it has been out of the water.\n        *   Decontamination procedures are in place for high-risk watercraft.\n        *   Failure to stop at an open inspection station could result in a fine of $690.\n    *   **\"Clean, Drain, Dry\":**\n        *   A public awareness campaign emphasizes the importance of cleaning, draining, and drying boats and equipment before moving between water bodies.\n        *   It is illegal to transport watercraft with the drain plug still in place.\n        *   Education materials (posters, information cards) are distributed at Alberta Parks and other locations.\n    *   **Monitoring:**\n        *   Alberta Parks and Alberta Environment and Protected Areas are collaborating to monitor water bodies for the presence of invasive species.\n    *   **Legislation and Enforcement**\n        *   The County of Newell’s Boating Safety and Aquatic Invasive Species Bylaw (2001-21) supports the EID program.\n\n4.  **Collaboration:**\n    *   Alberta Parks, Alberta Environment and Protected Areas, and other government and external agencies are working together on AIS prevention and response.\n    *   Alberta and British Columbia have a joint watercraft passport program for boaters who frequently travel between the two provinces.\n\n5.  **Economic Considerations:**\n    *   The government has conducted economic assessments to estimate the potential costs of a quagga/zebra mussel infestation, both generally and in specific locations like Lake McGregor. These assessments are used to justify the investment in prevention programs.\n\n6. **Emerging Watercraft Tax?**\n* It appears that the government is considering adding a boat tax for every watercraft in Alberta.\n\n**Talking Points for the Minister**\n\n*   \"Alberta is committed to protecting its aquatic ecosystems and economy from the threat of quagga and zebra mussels.\"\n*   \"Our focus is on prevention, as it is the most effective and cost-efficient way to manage these invasive species.\"\n*   \"We have a comprehensive program in place that includes mandatory watercraft inspections, public education, and collaboration with other jurisdictions.\"\n*   \"We are actively monitoring our water bodies and have a rapid response plan in place should an introduction occur.\"\n*   \"We are working with boaters and other stakeholders to ensure they understand their role in preventing the spread of aquatic invasive species.\"\n*   \"The economic impact assessments demonstrate the importance of investing in AIS prevention.\"\n* \"Can you please provide me with more information on the potential boat tax.\"\n\n**Potential Questions for the Minister**\n\n*   Are current funding levels for AIS prevention adequate, given the potential economic and environmental consequences of an infestation?\n*   How can we further enhance public awareness and compliance with \"Clean, Drain, Dry\" practices?\n*   Are there opportunities to strengthen collaboration with neighboring provinces and states on AIS prevention?\n*   What are the next steps in the rapid response plan, and how frequently is it updated?\n*   What is the status of the boat tax?\n\n**Areas for Further Research/Action**\n\n*   **Efficacy of Inspection Stations:**  Evaluate the effectiveness of current inspection station locations and hours of operation.\n*   **Compliance Rates:**  Assess compliance rates with mandatory inspection requirements and \"Clean, Drain, Dry\" practices.\n*   **Targeted Education:**  Develop targeted education campaigns for specific user groups (e.g., anglers, recreational boaters, commercial operators).\n*   **Rapid Response Plan Details:** Obtain a detailed briefing on the province's rapid response plan, including roles, responsibilities, and available resources.\n*   **New Technologies:**  Explore the use of new technologies for early detection and monitoring of AIS.\n\nThis briefing should provide the Minister with a solid understanding of Alberta's current efforts to combat quagga and zebra mussels and equip them to answer questions and make informed decisions on this important issue.\n"

First, I will complete the pre-generation deep analysis.\n\n## Pre-Generation Step: Deep Analysis\n\n**Analysis Topic:** Alberta's approach to preventing aquatic invasive species (AIS), specifically quagga and zebra mussels, and the consideration of a watercraft tax.\n\n**Evidence-Based Insights:**\n\n1.  **Prevention Focus is Justified:** The briefing material strongly emphasizes prevention as the most cost-effective strategy, which aligns with established best practices for invasive species management. The estimated $75 million annual cost of an infestation underscores the potential economic impact and supports proactive measures. Evidence from other jurisdictions (implied but not explicitly stated) likely demonstrates the difficulty and expense of eradication.\n2.  **Watercraft Inspection Effectiveness Needs Scrutiny:** While mandatory watercraft inspections are a cornerstone of Alberta's program, the briefing raises questions about their efficacy. Evaluating inspection station locations, hours, and compliance rates is crucial to ensure resources are being used effectively. Data on the number of inspections performed, the number of contaminated boats intercepted, and the origin of those boats would be valuable.\n3.  **Public Awareness is Key, but Requires Targeted Approaches:** The \"Clean, Drain, Dry\" campaign is essential, but its success depends on widespread adoption. Assessing compliance rates and tailoring education campaigns to specific user groups (anglers, recreational boaters, commercial operators) could significantly improve its impact.\n4.  **Collaboration is Vital, but Should Be Expanded:** The existing collaboration between Alberta Parks and Alberta Environment and Protected Areas is a positive foundation. However, strengthening partnerships with neighboring provinces (particularly Saskatchewan, which is also at risk) and states, as well as engaging with federal agencies, could enhance prevention efforts.\n5.  **Watercraft Tax Requires Careful Consideration:** The potential implementation of a watercraft tax is a significant development. It raises questions about fairness, economic impact on boaters and the tourism industry, and the potential for revenue generation to offset the costs of AIS prevention. A thorough cost-benefit analysis and stakeholder consultation are essential before proceeding.\n\n**Legal Opinion:** A legal opinion would be needed to assess the province's authority to implement a watercraft tax, to ensure compliance with existing trade agreements, and to address potential legal challenges from boaters or industry groups.\n\nNow, I will generate the full briefing note, strictly following the template.\n\n**ADVICE TO HONOURABLE [Minister's Name]**\n**MINISTER OF TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION**\n**FOR DECISION**\n\n**PURPOSE**\nTo provide the Minister information regarding Alberta's efforts to prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS), specifically quagga and zebra mussels, and to seek a decision on further exploring the feasibility and implications of implementing a watercraft tax to support these efforts.\n\n**BACKGROUND**\nAlberta is currently free of quagga and zebra mussels. These species pose a significant environmental and economic threat to the province. The government has focused on prevention, primarily through watercraft inspections and public education initiatives like \"Clean, Drain, Dry.\" Key actions include collaboration between Alberta Parks, Alberta Environment and Protected Areas, and other agencies.\n*   Mandatory watercraft inspections are in place, particularly for vessels entering Alberta from higher-risk areas (e.g., Manitoba, Ontario, southwestern United States). Failure to stop at an open inspection station could result in a fine of $690.\n*   It is illegal to transport watercraft with the drain plug still in place.\n*   Economic assessments have estimated the potential costs of a quagga/zebra mussel infestation at over $75 million annually.\n*   The County of Newell’s Boating Safety and Aquatic Invasive Species Bylaw (2001-21) supports the EID program.\nThe government is now considering a watercraft tax for every watercraft in Alberta to further fund AIS prevention efforts.\n*   This consideration is new, and there is no established public record on this specific proposal.\n\n**ANALYSIS**\nAlberta's primary strategy is to prevent the introduction of quagga and zebra mussels. Prevention is more cost-effective than managing an infestation. The government has conducted economic assessments to justify the investment in prevention programs. The addition of a watercraft tax will require careful consideration. This work aligns with the Minister's Mandate Letter items of supporting environmental sustainability and responsible resource management and key government priorities including protecting Alberta's natural resources and promoting economic diversification.\n\n**Key Considerations**\n*   **Efficacy of Inspection Stations:** Evaluate the effectiveness of current inspection station locations and hours of operation. Data on inspection numbers, intercepted contaminated boats, and origin of boats is needed.\n*   **Compliance Rates:** Assess compliance rates with mandatory inspection requirements and \"Clean, Drain, Dry\" practices. Targeted education campaigns for specific user groups (e.g., anglers, recreational boaters, commercial operators) may be needed.\n*   **Stakeholder Impact of Watercraft Tax:** A watercraft tax could generate revenue for AIS prevention but may face opposition from boaters and the tourism industry. A thorough cost-benefit analysis and stakeholder consultation are essential. A legal opinion is needed to assess the province's authority to implement such a tax.\n\n**Jurisdictional Comparisons**\nOther jurisdictions, such as British Columbia, also have robust AIS prevention programs. Alberta and British Columbia have a joint watercraft passport program for boaters who frequently travel between the two provinces. Research into how other provinces and states fund their AIS programs (e.g., through general revenue, user fees, or dedicated taxes) is needed.\n\n**Options Under Consideration**\n\n*   **Option 1 (Recommended):** Conduct a comprehensive feasibility study and stakeholder consultation on the implementation of a watercraft tax, including a cost-benefit analysis and legal review.\n    *   Pros: Potential for dedicated funding stream for AIS prevention; may enhance program effectiveness.\n    *   Cons: Potential opposition from boaters and tourism industry; administrative costs of implementation; legal challenges.\n    *   Risks/Mitigation: Negative public perception (mitigation: transparent communication); legal challenges (mitigation: thorough legal review); low compliance (mitigation: incentives/enforcement).\n*   **Option 2:** Enhance existing AIS prevention programs through increased funding from general revenue, without implementing a watercraft tax.\n    *   Pros: Avoids potential opposition to a new tax; simpler implementation.\n    *   Cons: Funding may be less stable and subject to budget fluctuations; may not be sufficient to address the growing threat of AIS.\n    *   Risks/Mitigation: Insufficient funding (mitigation: prioritize high-impact activities); lack of public awareness (mitigation: enhance existing education programs).\n*   **Option 3 (Status Quo):** Maintain current AIS prevention programs at existing funding levels.\n    *   Pros: No immediate costs or disruptions.\n    *   Cons: May be inadequate to prevent the introduction and spread of AIS, given the increasing risk; could result in significant economic and environmental damage in the long term.\n    *   Risks/Mitigation: Increased risk of AIS introduction (mitigation: enhance monitoring efforts); potential for costly infestation (mitigation: develop a robust rapid response plan).\n\nThe attached *Aquatic Invasive Species Prevention Program Details* demonstrates the current scope of Alberta's AIS prevention efforts. Benefits of the recommended direction include a more informed decision-making process regarding the watercraft tax and a better understanding of its potential impacts.\n\n**FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS**\nThe recommended Option 1 (feasibility study and stakeholder consultation) will require funding for research, analysis, and consultation activities. The exact cost will depend on the scope of the study, but it is estimated to be in the range of $50,000 - $100,000. No financial implications if the government continues with the status quo.\n\n**STAKEHOLDER REACTION**\nKey stakeholders include recreational boaters, anglers, tourism operators, environmental groups, irrigation districts, power companies, and municipalities. Anticipate mixed reactions to the watercraft tax proposal. Boaters and tourism operators may oppose the tax, while environmental groups and infrastructure operators may support it. Consultations should involve these groups to gather feedback and address concerns.\n\n**NEXT STEPS**\nIf the Minister approves Option 1, the following steps will be taken:\n*   Initiate a comprehensive feasibility study on the implementation of a watercraft tax (timeline: 2 months).\n*   Conduct stakeholder consultations with key groups to gather feedback and address concerns (timeline: 1 month).\n*   Analyze the results of the feasibility study and stakeholder consultations (timeline: 1 month).\n*   Present findings and recommendations to the Minister for a final decision (timeline: 1 month).\n\n**ATTACHMENT**\n1.
