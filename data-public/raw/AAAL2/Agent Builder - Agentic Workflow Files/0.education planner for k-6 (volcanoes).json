CNN &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; Things are heating up hundreds of miles off the coast of Oregon, where a large undersea volcano is showing signs of impending eruption, scientists say. The volcano, known as Axial Seamount , is located nearly 1 mile (1.4 kilometers) underwater on a geological hot spot, where searing gushes of molten rock rise from Earth’s mantle and into the crust. Hotspot volcanoes are common on the seafloor. But Axial Seamount also happens to be located on the Juan de Fuca Ridge — an area where two massive tectonic plates (the Pacific and the Juan de Fuca plates) are constantly spreading apart, causing a steady buildup of pressure beneath the planet’s surface. The frequency of earthquakes has recently picked up dramatically as the volcano inflates with increasingly more magma, signaling an eruption could be near, according to researchers at the National Science Foundation’s Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array, a facility operated by the University of Washington that monitors the activity of Axial Seamount. CN7CJ3 Uturuncu volcano in Bolivia in South America Michael Sayles/Alamy Stock Photo Related article Scientists explore the anatomy of a ‘zombie volcano’ that’s showing signs of activity “At the moment, there are a couple hundred earthquakes a day, but that’s still a lot less than we saw before the previous eruption,” said William Wilcock, a marine geophysicist and professor at the University of Washington School of Oceanography who studies the volcano. “I would say it was going to erupt sometime later (this year) or early 2026, but it could be tomorrow, because it’s completely unpredictable,” he said. What happens during an eruption? During the volcano’s last eruption in April 2015, the team observed about 10,000 small-scale earthquakes in a 24-hour period, and the same can be expected for the next one, Wilcock said. Magma — molten rock beneath Earth’s surface — oozed out of Axial Seamount for a month and trailed about 25 miles (\n\n\n---\n\n=== Ring of Fire - Wikipedia ===\nRing of Fire - Wikipedia Jump to content Main menu Main menu move to sidebar hide Navigation Main page Contents Current events Random article About Wikipedia Contact us Contribute Help Learn to edit Community portal Recent changes Upload file Special pages Search Search Appearance Donate Create account Log in Personal tools Donate Create account Log in Pages for logged out editors learn more Contributions Talk Contents move to sidebar hide (Top) 1 History 2 Geographic boundaries Toggle Geographic boundaries subsection 2.1 Land areas 3 Tectonic plate configurations Toggle Tectonic plate configurations subsection 3.1 Past plate configurations 3.2 Present-day plate configuration 4 Subduction zones and oceanic trenches Toggle Subduction zones and oceanic trenches subsection 4.1 Oceanic trenches 4.2 Gaps 5 Distribution of volcanoes 6 Very large events Toggle Very large events subsection 6.1 Volcanic eruptions 6.2 Earthquakes 7 Antarctica 8 South America Toggle South America subsection 8.1 Chile 8.2 Argentina 8.3 Bolivia 8.4 Peru 8.5 Ecuador 8.6 Colombia 9 North America Toggle North America subsection 9.1 Central America 9.1.1 Costa Rica 9.1.2 Nicaragua 9.1.3 Honduras 9.1.4 El Salvador 9.1.5 Guatemala 9.2 North American Cordillera 9.2.1 Mexico 9.2.2 United States 9.2.3 Canada 10 Asia Toggle Asia subsection 10.1 Russia 10.2 Japan 10.3 Taiwan 10.4 Philippines 10.5 Indonesia 11 Islands in the southwest Pacific Ocean Toggle Islands in the southwest Pacific Ocean subsection 11.1 Papua New Guinea 11.2 Solomon Islands 11.3 Vanuatu 11.4 Fiji 11.5 Samoa 11.6 Tonga 11.7 New Zealand 12 Soil 13 See also 14 Notes 15 References 16 External links Toggle the table of contents Ring of Fire 76 languages Afrikaans العربية Asturianu Basa Bali বাংলা Basa Banyumasan Беларуская भोजपुरी Bikol Central Български Bosanski Català Čeština Dansk الدارجة Deutsch Eesti Ελληνικά Español Esperanto Euskara فارسی Français Gaeilge Galego 한국어 Հայերեն हिन्दी Hrvatski Ilokano Bahasa Indonesia Íslenska Italiano עברית Jawa ქართული Қазақша ລາວ Latina Latviešu Lietuvių Magyar Македонски മലയാളം Bahasa Melayu Nederlands 日本語 Norsk bokmål Norsk nynorsk Occitan پنجابی Polski Português Română Русский Shqip Simple English سنڌي Slovenčina Slovenščina Српски / srpski Srpskohrvatski / српскохрватски Sunda Suomi Svenska Tagalog தமிழ் ไทย Türkçe Українська اردو Tiếng Việt Winaray 吴语 ייִדיש 中文 Edit links Article Talk English Read View source View history Tools Tools move to sidebar hide Actions Read View source View history General What links here Related changes Upload file Permanent link Page information Cite this page Get shortened URL Download QR code Print/export Download as PDF Printable version In other projects Wikimedia Commons Wikidata item Appearance move to sidebar hide From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Tectonic belt of volcanoes and earthquakes For other uses, see Ring of Fire (disambiguation) .

It is about 40,000&#160;km (25,000&#160;mi) long &#91; 1 &#93; and up to about 500&#160;km (310&#160;mi) wide, &#91; 2 &#93; and surrounds most of the Pacific Ocean . The Ring of Fire contains between 750 and 915 active or dormant volcanoes, around two-thirds of the world total. &#91; 3 &#93; &#91; 4 &#93; The exact number of volcanoes within the Ring of Fire depends on which regions are included. About 90% of the world's earthquakes, &#91; 5 &#93; including most of its largest, &#91; 6 &#93; &#91; 7 &#93; occur within the belt. The Ring of Fire is not a single geological structure. It was created by the subduction of different tectonic plates at convergent boundaries around the Pacific Ocean.

(KPTV) - The Axial Seamount is the most active volcano in the Pacific Northwest, sitting 300 miles off the coast of Oregon and nearly a mile underwater in the Pacific Ocean, along the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Scientists who are monitoring the volcano have said that an eruption is due before the end of 2025. Bill Chadwick of Oregon State University and Scott Noonen are the authors of a new study on the Axial Seamount volcano off of the Oregon coast. The Axial Seamount last erupted in 2015, and before that it had eruptions in 2011 and 1998. Oregon State University geophysicist William Chadwick said, “at the rate of inflation it’s going, I expect it to erupt by the end of the year.” The volcano has been chosen as the site of the world’s first underwater volcano observatory and is being closely monitored by scientists at Oregon State University, as well as the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. Scientific instruments at the base of the western caldera wall of the Axial Seamount volcano. (NOAA) In June, this year, scientists detected over 2,000 earthquakes in a single day at the volcano. Since then, the surge has tapered off, but hundreds of earthquakes continue to be recorded at the site daily and the seafloor has ballooned to a similar level to the 2015 eruption. Seismic activity and the bulging ocean floor are a sign that magma is moving up through cracks underneath the volcano. SEE ALSO: An 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Russia caused volcanoes to erupt in the region. Could the same thing happen in North America? In a recent blog post by Oregon State’s College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences scientists noted the rate of earthquakes has been “wavering up and down” but admitted they don’t know “what it will take to trigger the next eruption and exactly when that will happen.” Chadwick said when the submarine volcano erupts it won’t be explosive, and therefore doesn’t pose a tsunami risk and will have no effect on human life on the West Coast. Instead, the volcano is more like volcanoes in Hawaii and Iceland, with less gas. The lava is very fluid and oozes out steadily during an eruption. During an eruption, the lava will flow out of the volcano and almost immediately cool down when it hits the seawater, forming a crust. Sea life on the ocean floor near the volcano can be die if it’s buried by the lava. But scientists say the eruption most likely won’t affect animals like whales because they don’t swim nearly deep enough. Copyright 2025 KPTV-KPDX. All rights reserved.

Leveled by Selected text level Default Article Vocabulary Learning materials Maps National Geographic MapMaker: Volcanoes Around the World National Geographic MapMaker: Plate Tectonics The Ring of Fire is a string of volcanoes and sites of seismic activity, or earthquakes , around the edges of the Pacific Ocean. Roughly 90 percent of all earthquakes occur along the Ring of Fire, and the ring is dotted with 75 percent of all active volcanoes on Earth. The Ring of Fire isn’t quite a circular ring. It is shaped more like a 40,000-kilometer (25,000-mile) horseshoe . A string of 452 volcanoes stretches from the southern tip of South America, up along the coast of North America, across the Bering Strait , down through Japan, and into New Zealand. Several active and dormant volcanoes in Antarctica, however, “close” the ring. Plate Boundaries The Ring of Fire is the result of plate tectonics . Tectonic plates are huge slabs of Earth’s crust , which fit together like pieces of a puzzle. The plates are not fixed but are constantly moving atop a layer of solid and molten rock called the mantle . Sometimes these plates collide , move apart, or slide next to each other. Most tectonic activity in the Ring of Fire occurs in these geologically active zones. Convergent Boundaries A convergent plate boundary is formed by tectonic plates crashing into each other. Convergent boundaries are often subduction zones , where the heavier plate slips under the lighter plate, creating a deep trench . This subduction changes the dense mantle material into buoyant magma , which rises through the crust to Earth’s surface. Over millions of years, the rising magma creates a series of active volcanoes known as a volcanic arc . If you were to drain the water out of the Pacific Ocean, you would see a series of deep ocean trenches that run parallel to corresponding volcanic arcs along the Ring of Fire . These arcs create both islands and continental mountain ranges . The Aleutian Islands in the U.S. state of Alaska, for example, run parallel to the Aleutian Trench. Both geographic features continue to form as the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the North American Plate. The Aleutian Trench reaches a maximum depth of 7,679 meters (25,194 feet). The Aleutian Islands have 27 of the United States’ 65 historically active volcanoes. The Andes Mountains of South America run parallel to the Peru-Chile Trench, created as the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate. The Andes Mountains include the world’s highest active volcano, Nevados Ojos del Salado, which rises to 6,879 meters (over 22,500 feet) along the Chile-Argentina border. Many volcanoes in Antarctica are so geologically linked to the South American part of the Ring of Fire that some geologists refer to the region as the “Antarctandes.” Divergent Boundaries A divergent boundary is formed by tectonic plates pulling apart from each other. Divergent boundaries are the site of seafloor spreading and rift valleys . Seafloor spreading is the process of magma welling up in the rift as the old crust pulls itself in opposite directions. Cold seawater cools the magma , creating new crust . The upward movement and eventual cooling of this magma has created high ridges on the ocean floor over millions of years. The East Pacific Rise is a site of major seafloor spreading in the Ring of Fire. The East Pacific Rise is located on the divergent boundary of the Pacific Plate and the Cocos Plate (west of Central America), the Nazca Plate (west of South America), and the Antarctic Plate. In addition to volcanic activity, the rise also has a number of hydrothermal vents. Transform Boundaries A transform boundary is formed as tectonic plates slide horizontally past each other. Parts of these plates get stuck at the places where they touch. Stress builds in those areas as the rest of the plates continue to move. This stress causes the rock to break or slip, suddenly lurching the plates forward and causing earthquakes . These areas of breakage or slippage are called faults . The majority of Earth’s faults can be found along transform boundaries in the Ring of Fire . The San Andreas Fault, stretching along the central west coast of North America, is one of the most active faults on the Ring of Fire. It lies on the transform boundary between the North American Plate, which is moving south, and the Pacific Plate, which is moving north. Measuring about 1,287 kilometers (800 miles) long and 16 kilometers (10 miles) deep, the fault cuts through the western part of the U.S. state of California.

The volcano is known as Axial Seamount , and while it may not be a cultural icon like its cousins in the Cascade Range, scientists are excited because it is giving us a window into some of the most important geological and biological processes on Earth. Ocean Observatories Initiative The Regional Cabled Array spans the entire Juan de Fuca tectonic plate, from the Oregon coast to the summit of Axial Seamount 300 miles offshore. “Over two-thirds of the Earth’s surface was formed by volcanic eruptions at these mid-ocean ridges,” said Maya Tolstoy , a marine geophysicist and Maggie Walker Dean of the UW College of the Environment. “So the volcano is formed by these really fundamental processes that shape our planet.” Maya Tolstoy Maggie Walker Dean // Professor, Oceanography Maya Tolstoy is a marine geophysicist specializing in seafloor earthquakes and volcanoes and the Maggie Walker Dean of the University of Washington College of the Environment. Learn more In December of 2024, researchers at the annual American Geophysical Union conference shared some exciting news: Axial Seamount was well on its way to an eruption , possibly before the end of 2025. The news attracted international attention and a flurry of questions from jittery Pacific Northwesterners. Could an eruption be dangerous for those of us on land? How might it affect the likelihood of a major regional earthquake? And what might it mean for some of our region’s iconic animals, like orcas and salmon? Ed McNichol Researchers prepare to install a multi-instrument vehicle known as a deep profiler on the Regional Cabled Array. The UW College of the Environment is home to one of the world’s largest underwater observatories hosting networks of sensors on the seafloor and throughout the ocean waters. The array, which sends real-time data from 150 instruments to shore at the speed of light, spans the Juan de Fuca plate, from the Oregon coast to the summit of Axial Seamount 300 miles offshore. Known as the Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array (RCA) , this facility has provided unique insights into the dynamics of the ocean and underlying seafloor since 2014 — including high-resolution images and even a live video feed — and when the volcano finally erupts, it will give scientists a front-row seat.

Download (mp4, 12.4 MB) Most of the active volcanoes on Earth are located underwater, along the aptly named “Ring of Fire” in the Pacific Ocean. Made up of more than 450 volcanoes, the Ring of Fire stretches for nearly 40,250 kilometers (25,000 miles), running in the shape of a horseshoe (as opposed to an actual ring) from the southern tip of South America, along the west coast of North America, across the Bering Strait, down through Japan, and into New Zealand. The Ring of Fire is the result of plate tectonics. Much of the volcanic activity occurs along subduction zones, which are convergent plate boundaries where two tectonic plates come together. The heavier plate is shoved (or subducted) under the other plate. When this happens, melting of the plates produces magma that rises up through the overlying plate, erupting to the surface as a volcano. Subduction zones are also where Earth’s deepest ocean trenches are located and where deep earthquakes happen. The trenches form because as one plate subducts under another, it is bent downward. Earthquakes occur as the two plates scrape against each other and as the subducting plate bends.

The Axial Seamount volcano is located nearly a mile beneath the sea approximately 300 miles off the Oregon Coast, just west of Astoria and along the Juan de Fuca Ridge. The volcanic activity the Axial Seamount has recently displayed has scientists on their toes as it may be due for another eruption soon. The underwater volcano has experienced three eruptions in the last 30 years, the most recent ones happening in 2011 and 2015. According to USA Today , the volcano has “erupted about 50 times over the last 800 years, about once every 15 years on average.” Here's what to know. Why do researchers believe an underwater volcano off the Oregon Coast will erupt in 2025? Researchers at Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science Center are monitoring the Axial Seamount's activity in real time by using approximately 660 miles of undersea cables. Known as the Regional Cabled Array , it uses more than 140 instruments to constantly monitor activity. Bill Chadwick, a volcanologist and research professor at OSU, said their observations have revealed a pattern. “It’s at or almost at that inflation threshold where it erupted last time. So, we think it’s ready to erupt,” Chadwick told KGW earlier this year, adding its activity has picked up in the last year. The pattern Chadwick spoke of shows rises in the seafloor that indicate magma is slowly accumulating and moving beneath the volcano's surface, causing an increased number of small earthquakes. What will happen if Axial Seamount off the Oregon Coast erupts? Even if the Axial Seamount volcano erupts this year, there is no danger to people. While it is said the eruption could cause a series of small earthquakes, they aren't likely to be felt on land due to the volcano's depth and how far offshore it is. The lava flows that come from Axial Seamount will have no effect on the surface of the ocean either and will only reshape the seafloor. If the researcher's predictions come true, the underwater volcano will provide a better understanding of how to predict volcanic eruptions. What car is stolen the most in Oregon?

Now, seismic activity near the volcano is ramping up as well. In June, more than 2,000 earthquakes were recorded in a single day, according to Oregon State University . In this image released by the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory at NOAA, a 3D image of Axial Seamount bathymetry is shown.

Do volcanoes occur in the ocean? to emphasize a key word or two--> The greatest number of the Earth's volcanoes occur on the ocean floor . ROV Jason gets a close view of magma explosions and lava flows on West Mata volcano. Volcanic eruptions occur only in certain places and do not occur randomly. This is because the Earth&rsquo;s crust is broken into a series of slabs known as tectonic plates. These plates are rigid, but they &ldquo;float&rdquo; on a hotter, softer layer in the Earth's interior. As the plates move, they spread apart, collide, or slide past each other. Sixty percent of all active volcanoes occur at the boundaries between tectonic plates. Most volcanoes are found along a belt, called the &ldquo;Ring of Fire&rdquo; that encircles the Pacific Ocean. Some volcanoes, like those that form the Hawaiian Islands, occur in the interior of plates at areas called &ldquo;hot spots.&rdquo; Although most of the active volcanoes we see on land occur where plates collide, the greatest number of the Earth's volcanoes are hidden from view, occurring on the ocean floor along spreading ridges.

Most of these volcanoes are thousands of feet deep, and difficult to find. But in May of 2009, scientists captured the deepest ocean eruption ever found. Nearly 4000 feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean – in an area between Samoa, Fiji and Tonga - the West Mata volcano was discovered. The explosions of molten rock were spectacular. This volcano was producing Boninite lavas – believed to be among the hottest erupting on Earth. Scientists also witnessed molten lava flowing across the deep-ocean sea floor and spotted shrimp living near the volcano&rsquo;s most active areas. This research allows us to closely examine how ocean islands and undersea volcanoes are born. It may also shed light on how heat and matter transfer from the interior of the Earth to the surface, and how life adapts to some of the harshest conditions on our planet. Finding West Mata was a huge break for scientists and for those interested in seeing what takes place in the deepest depths of our ocean. Transcripción NARRADOR: Los científicos creen que el 80 por ciento de las erupciones volcánicas de la Tierra se originan en el océano. La mayoría de estos volcanes se encuentran a miles de metros de profundidad, y son difíciles de encontrar. Sin embargo, en mayo de 2009, los científicos capturaron la erupción oceánica más profunda que se ha registrado. Cerca de 1,220 metros bajo la superficie del Océano Pacífico, en una zona entre Samoa, Fiji y Tonga, el volcán West Mata fue descubierto. Las explosiones de roca fundida fueron espectaculares. Este volcán estuvo produciendo lavas de boninita la cual se cree están entre las erupciones más calientes en la Tierra. Los científicos también fueron testigos de lava fluyendo a través del lecho marino del océano profundo y de camarones moteados viviendo cerca de las zonas de mayor actividad del volcán. Esta investigación nos permite examinar de cerca cómo las islas oceánicas y los volcanes submarinos nacen. También puede arrojar a la luz cómo el calor y la materia se transmiten del interior de la Tierra a la superficie, y cómo la vida se adapta a algunas de las condiciones más duras de nuestro planeta. El encontrar al West Mata fue un gran avance para los científicos y para aquellos interesados ​​en ver lo que ocurre en lo más profundo de nuestro océano.

During the 2009 response cruise, seven dives were conducted by Jason remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives. The Jason ROV is operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). Within a little more than an hour of reaching the bottom at West Mata on the first dive an active eruption was discovered at 1,205 m (3,950 ft) near the summit of the volcano. The eruption was characterized by glowing molten lava, explosions, the creation of large amounts of volcanic sands, and the active formation of pillow lavas. --> Feedback Provide Feedback --> Contact Us Report an error --> Subscribe Social Science.

Roughly 1,000 miles off the eastern coast of Japan, the Pacific Northwest is home to the giant Tamu Massif. Previously thought to be an area with lots of eruption points rather than just one, core samples and other evidence have confirmed that Tamu Massif erupted from a single, central source. &#8220;We knew it was big, but we had no idea it was one large volcano,&#8221; wrote Will Sager of the University of Houston in the journal Nature Geoscience , outlining the discovery. &#8220;Its shape is different from any other submarine volcano found on Earth, and it&#8217;s very possible it can give us some clues about how massive volcanoes can form.&#8221; Sager named it the volcano Tamu after the initials of Texas A&#038;M University, where he previously taught. Massif is French for &#8220;massive&#8221; and refers to a section of the Earth&#8217;s crust that is demarcated by faults and flexures . The largest active volcano on Earth is Hawaii&#8217;s Mauna Loa. But at 2,000 square miles, it&#8217;s just a comparative speck &#8212; less than 2 percent the size of Tamu Massif. A more worthy fellow volcano is Olympus Mons, the Mars goliath that backyard astronomers can see on a clear night. Mars&#8217; largest volcano, Olympus Mons is only about 25 percent larger by volume than Tamu Massif. Tamu Massif is believed to be about 145 million years old, and became inactive a few million years after it was formed according to Sci-News.com .

This 6-part BBC mini-series of the South Pacific shows not only clichéd postcard-style images, but also the south pacific&#39;s diverse wildlife, people, history and its condition today. Interesting stories alternate with amazing images from the air as well as in the water. At the end of every Episode, the &quot;South Pacific Diaries&quot; show the difficulties the team experienced while filming and the high-tech material they used. As the BBC is not only ad-driven, they were able to invest a huge amount of money, which pays off: top-notch direction, sound, narrating and image quality (check the blu-ray!). I see no big flaws, only the wildlife parts are in a few cases a bit boring. 9 TheLittleSongbird Volcanic oceans &#39;South Pacific&#39; is a hugely informative and exceptionally well-made series. Inevitable, though some may argue unfair, comparisons may be (have been in fact) made to the output of David Attenborough, to me &#39;South Pacific&#39; is one of the better documentary series in recent years to not have Attenborough&#39;s name on it and stands wonderfully on its own, if just lacking the special magic of Attenborough&#39;s best work. There are so many great things in &#39;South Pacific&#39;. Its premise is dealt with exceptionally in every single episode, the environments, how they&#39;re lived in, how the humans adapt to the environments, there are some very interesting topics and important ones handled truly admirably. Also in a way that is illuminating but not preachy (which is a potential danger with anything environmental-themed and a danger often fallen into). After three wonderful previous episodes, &quot;Ocean of Volcanoes&quot; had a lot to live up to. A hard feat that it accomplished extremely well. Sure, there could have been a touch more clarity in parts, but there is very little to dislike here.

However, the structure of these volcanoes, and how they erupt and evolve, is unclear, because they are remote and submerged beneath the oceans. Here we use multichannel seismic profiles and rock samples taken from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program core sites to analyse the structure of the Tamu Massif, the oldest and largest edifice of the Shatsky Rise oceanic plateau in the north-western Pacific Ocean. We show that the Tamu Massif is a single, immense volcano, constructed from massive lava flows that emanated from the volcano centre to form a broad, shield-like shape. The volcano has anomalously low slopes, probably due to the high effusion rates of the erupting lavas. We suggest that the Tamu Massif could be the largest single volcano on Earth and that it is comparable in size to the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons on Mars. Our data document a class of oceanic volcanoes that is distinguished by its size and morphology from the thousands of seamounts found throughout the oceans.

The most active volcano in the Pacific Northwest is the Axial Seamount. It’s located 300 miles west of Astoria, Oregon, and a mile under the ocean. It’s erupted three times in the past 25 years. THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor And now after a few years of relative slumber, the undersea volcano appears to be waking up again. Data collected on Axial show the magma chamber is filling up and hundreds of small earthquakes are happening in the area each day. “Axial is the most active volcano in the Northeast Pacific, which maybe some people don’t know because it’s hidden under the ocean,” said Oregon State University volcanologist Bill Chadwick. “It’s actually more active than any of the volcanoes we’re familiar with, like the ones in the Cascades — Mount St. Helens, Mount Hood, Mount Rainier.” Related: Deep-sea volcano off the Oregon Coast helps scientists forecast eruptions Chadwick and his colleagues have been studying the Axial Seamount for decades, traveling to the volcano every couple of years to collect data from instruments on the seafloor. The Axial Seamount is a shield volcano — like you’d find in Hawaii or Iceland — meaning it doesn’t blow its top when it erupts. Instead the magma below causes it to crack open on its slopes and ooze syrupy lava. “It doesn’t have that flashy, ‘Axial’s gonna erupt and cause a tsunami,’” said Jeff Beeson, a geologist at Oregon State University. “It’s not happening. [The volcano is] not going to erupt and have a lava flow that goes into someone’s backyard.” But because Axial is so active, it’s extremely valuable for scientists who are trying to learn about volcanoes. In this video still, Oregon State University volcanologist and chief scientist on the research cruise, Bill Chadwick (right), works on schedule for the multiple projects happening aboard the RV Thompson. Stephani Gordon/OPB / OPB “We’re trying to understand how it evolves over time. How the magma moves leading up to an eruption and during an eruption. What happens right after an eruption? These are things that are not really that well understood about volcanoes in general,” said Chadwick’s research partner Scott Nooner, a geophysicist at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington . They’re also trying to figure out how to accurately forecast when volcanoes will erupt, work that is funded in part by the National Science Foundation. The last time the Axial Seamount erupted was in 2015. Almost immediately after the eruption, scientific instruments around the volcano showed that the surface was rising up, inflating like a balloon, an indication that the magma chamber had started to rapidly fill up again . And so it looked as if the volcano was heading towards another eruption. THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor Related: Battling crabs 250 miles off the Oregon Coast, while studying an underwater volcano Seeing this rapid inflation, Chadwick predicted that the volcano would erupt between 2020 and 2024. But almost immediately after he published that prediction, Axial seemed to change its mind. Chadwick says the rate of magma buildup “slowed way down.” And Axial has not erupted again. “It’s always going to be somewhat of a challenge to really know what’s happening underground where you can’t see it,” Chadwick said. But this past January, things started to change again. Data collected by the Ocean Observatories Initiative Cabled Array (a permanent cable running from Pacific City, Oregon, out to the Axial Seamount) indicates the rate of seafloor inflation has nearly doubled. Visualization of the Axial Seamount, an active volcano off the Oregon Coast. NOAA In addition, researchers at the University of Washington have observed the number of small earthquakes happening around Axial has increased significantly. Before the eruption in 2015, researchers saw the number of earthquakes skyrocket. “Comparing this to the buildup to the 2015 eruption … suggests we may be getting close to being in a comparable buildup stage,” Chadwick wrote in his blog . Based on what he’s seeing, Chadwick says he has a new and “wildly optimistic” Axial eruption forecast: sometime in 2025 or 2026. “At a real dangerous volcano, you don’t want to be issuing any predictions that you’re not sure are going to be true, because people might have to evacuate. There could be economic costs and freaking people out,” he says.

(Courtesy of University of Tasmania) Three thousand feet (900 meters) beneath the sea surface, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, lies one of the world’s largest volcanoes, called Havre. The magnitude of its most recent eruption rivals some of the most memorable eruptions in recent history—for up to 90 days in 2012 lava poured out from a total of 14 vents around the semicircular volcanic opening. It is the largest deep-water eruption ever recorded in modern times, and scientists estimate that the amount of spewed lava, pumice, and ash was similar to what Mount St. Helens produced during its eruption of 1980. Yet, despite its awesome size and power, the Havre eruption was almost overlooked. A passenger on a commercial flight happened to glance out her window at the right moment and saw an oddly colored patch on the ocean. She thought it might be an oil slick, or a floating pumice raft —a highly porous volcanic rock which is a telltale sign of a recent volcanic eruption. A quick email with an accompanying photo to a geologist prompted an international search for the culprit. It was also a chance discovery. More than 70 percent of all volcanic eruptions occur underwater and scientists are in the dark when it comes to understanding underwater volcanoes because the eruptions are cloaked from view by thousands of feet of water. In 2015, a team of scientists aboard the research vessel Roger Revelle sailed to the Havre eruption site 600 miles north of New Zealand with the mission of studying an underwater volcano relatively soon after it erupted. Through the lenses of cameras on the remotely operated vehicle Jason , an astonishing site was unveiled. Large chunks of volcanic pumice, some the size of Volkswagens, littered the seafloor, and a blanket of ash radiated out from the volcano summit. From several of the vents, lava had oozed out, sometimes piling up into domes. The scene was anything but expected. “It blew our expectations completely out of the water,” says Rebecca Carey, a researcher at the University of Tasmania and co-author on a study that explored the Havre volcano from a remotely operated vehicle. “With any ocean floor investigation, there is room for some really exciting discoveries because we just don’t have the understanding yet of how submarine volcanoes operate underwater.” At the onset of the expedition, the scientists expected to find layers of pumice and ash of a highly explosive eruption on the seafloor (like Krakatoa 1883 or Mount St Helens 1980). Instead, they found giant meter-sized boulders of pumice that suggest instead that foamy magma oozed out of the vent and broke up on contact with the seawater. (Courtesy of University of Tasmania) About 75 percent of the lava spewed from the Havre volcano made it to the surface and drifted away in the massive pumice raft first spotted by the passenger and also seen in satellite photos.&nbsp; It consisted of golf ball to soccer ball sized pieces that covered an area of the ocean the size of Philadelphia. The arrangement of the pumice boulders on the seafloor, sometimes precariously stacked four blocks high, suggested that these pieces were also at first buoyant but then gently sank as their pores became saturated with water. Other gas poor dense lavas flowed from the vents similar to lava that slowly flows out of the volcanoes of Hawaii. How is it that these different lava types form? Scientists still aren’t sure. Carey explains, “In the water, things get really quite complicated.” In any volcanic eruption, magma (molten rock beneath the Earth’s surface) rises from the depths of the Earth to the surface of the land or the seafloor.&nbsp; The magma contains dissolved gases, which form bubbles\n\n\n---\n\n=== FOX 12 Oregon - The Axial Seamount is the most active... ===\nFOX 12 Oregon - The Axial Seamount is the most active...

Since 1997, scientists have kept a careful eye on it using instruments that measure pressure on the ocean floor. Data shows that the volcano has been swelling, with changing rates that hint at an upcoming eruption. Its activity caught the attention of experts because it shows a pattern of erupting after reaching a particular level of inflation. Observers have noted that the volcano’s swelling slowed from 2015 to 2023, then sped up again in late 2023. By mid-2024, that rate hit 10 inches per year, while daily earthquakes soared into the hundreds. Mark Zumberge, a geophysicist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography , has described it this way: “It’s the most well-instrumented submarine volcano on the planet.” He and others use pressure sensors and AI-driven analysis to gauge shifts in earthquake patterns. William Chadwick of Oregon State University once referred to a 2015 eruption forecast as their “best forecasting success.” Where continental plates pull apart Axial Seamount rises from the Juan de Fuca Ridge , an underwater mountain range in the northeastern Pacific. At this ridge, the Earth’s crust pulls apart due to the motion of tectonic plates, allowing molten rock to rise up and shape new crust. Plates moving apart have built a chain of peaks called a mid-ocean ridge. These ridges rarely capture the public’s imagination, yet they form one of Earth’s largest continuous geological features. Geography of the underwater volcano Axial Seamount, located in the Juan de Fuca Ridge, an underwater mountain range. Credit: University of Washington The ridge separates the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate . When those plates drift away from each other, magma surfaces and hardens. Volcanic and seismic events dot this region, including those at Axial. Repeated eruptions at this particular volcano have given researchers a real-time window into volcanic processes that most can only study from old rocks on land. Axial Seamount eruptions Because Axial Seamount experiences frequent eruptions, it provides chances to fine-tune eruption predictions. Its swelling has reached levels that match those seen before past eruptions, prompting discussions about the next event possibly coming by the end of 2025.

White dashed lines denote the isotherms. Credit: Nature Since these eruptions have been fairly similar each time, scientists are learning which signs point to magma movement and what those signals might mean for future activity. Hydrothermal vents play a role in shaping local marine ecosystems. Lava flows and bursts of heated fluid feed specialized life, such as tube worms and clams, that flourish in dark, high-pressure environments. This small spot of deep-sea life is a reminder of how volcanic activity can spur biological communities in unexpected places. AI and new prediction methods A recent effort involves analyzing quake patterns prior to 2015. That study leverages machine learning to recognize signals that precede an eruption. Experts see these methods as a way to identify shifts in ground motion more quickly than manual approaches. As inflation picks up again, this automated tracking could help identify the precise moment when molten rock nears the surface. Zumberge and others draw on a network of sensors that map every tremor and change in ground tilt. “At Axial, we don’t have to worry about false alarms,” said Chadwick. Thanks to these tools, false starts &#8211; common in volcano monitoring &#8211; have not posed much confusion here. Beyond Axial Seamount&#8217;s slopes Underwater eruptions may seem distant to folks on land, but they have global significance. The 2022 Hunga Tonga event , for example, triggered a tsunami that caused an estimated $90 billion in losses. Though Axial Seamount itself poses little direct threat &#8211; shield volcanoes are less violent, and tremors here lack the force to create large waves &#8211; insights gained may aid efforts to forecast other, more hazardous sites. “There’s no crystal ball,” noted volcanologist Valerio Acocella,\n\n\n---\n\n=== 🚨 A massive underwater volcano is... - Hashem Al-Ghaili ===\n🚨 A massive underwater volcano is... - Hashem Al-Ghaili Facebook Log In Hashem Al-Ghaili&#x27;s Post Hashem Al-Ghaili Verified account July 15 · Shared with Public A massive underwater volcano is showing signs it could erupt any day now. Deep beneath the Pacific Ocean, the Axial Seamount—a massive underwater volcano off the Oregon coast—is rumbling. Nearly a mile below the surface, it&#x27;s inflating with magma and producing hundreds of small earthquakes each day, signaling an imminent eruption. With a summit caldera stretching six miles, Axial is a hotbed of geologic activity, perched on the boundary where tectonic plates drift apart. The volcano&#x27;s last major eruption in 2015 covered 25 miles of seafloor with lava and triggered a seismic storm of nearly 10,000 quakes in just 24 hours. Now, scientists are warning: the next eruption could happen at any moment. Despite the volcanic fury, life around Axial’s hydrothermal vents continues to astound. Extreme heat and minerals fuel ecosystems that bounce back astonishingly fast after eruptions, showcasing nature’s resilience. But this time, there’s a groundbreaking twist—researchers are preparing to live stream the eruption in real time, offering a rare look into Earth’s inner workings. Intriguingly, Axial’s past eruptions have all occurred when Earth was farthest from the Sun, suggesting tidal forces from the Moon may influence its timing. As the seafloor reshapes beneath the waves, the world will be watching—live. Source: Chadwick, W. W., Kelley, D. S., Tolstoy, M., Wilcock, W. S.

Much is known about the volcanoes on land within the Ring of Fire (including the Aleutians, the Cascades, the Andes), but little is known about the submarine volcanoes, simply because they are hidden underwater. The Submarine Ring of Fire program aims to explore this poorly understood realm and catalyze research into the extraordinary diversity of subduction zone hydrothermal vent ecosystems. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mariana Arc The Mariana Volcanic Arc extends from 13°N to 23°N in the western Pacific Ocean, northwest of Guam. The Mariana region contains 9 volcanic islands and more than 60 submarine volcanoes, of which at least 20 are hydrothermally active. Discoveries have included actively erupting volcanoes, sites emitting liquid CO2, and craters filled with bubbling molten sulfur, all with an extraordinary diversity of chemosynthetic biological communities. These discoveries inspired the establishment of the Mariana Trench Marine National Monument. Expeditions: 2010 | 2009 | 2006 | 2004 | 2003 &nbsp; More information is available on the EOI Mariana Arc page. NE Lau Basin The Lau Basin is home to the Earth's highest subduction rates and fastest-opening backarc basin, which results in one of the Earth’s most densely populated areas of submarine volcanism and hydrothermal activity. Exploratory expeditions in 2008-2011 discovered and mapped numerous sites of hydrothermal activity and discovered the deepest active eruption site ever witnessed. Expeditions: 2012 | 2010 | 2009 | 2008 &nbsp; More information is available on the EOI Lau Basin page. Kermadec Arc The Kermadec Arc is an active volcanic island arc stretching north-northeast from New Zealand's North Island towards Tonga. While only a few volcanoes in the arc are tall enough to form islands, it also includes about 30 submarine volcanoes. The EOI program has explored many of the submarine volcanoes of the Kermadec Arc with New Zealand and other international colleagues. Expeditions: 2007 | 2005 &nbsp; More information is available on the EOI Kermadec Arc page. Explorer Ridge Explorer Ridge lies at the northern end of a chain of 3 spreading centers located off the west coast of North America in the NE Pacific. Explorer Ridge consists of one major segment, Southern Explorer Ridge, and several smaller segments. Magic Mountain is a large active hydrothermal vent area located on the Southern Explorer Ridge. Before 2002, Explorer Ridge was the least explored of the NE Pacific spreading centers, even though it was known to have robust hydrothermal activity and is seismically active. The 2002 mapped the Magic Mountain vent site in unprecedented detail. Expeditions: 2002 &nbsp; More information is available on the EOI Explorer Ridge page.

Credit: NASA Earth Observatory image by Joshua Stevens using GOES imagery courtesy of NOAA and NESDIS The huge amount of water vapor hurled into the atmosphere, as detected by NASA’s Microwave Limb Sounder, could end up temporarily warming Earth’s surface. When the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupted on Jan. 15, it sent a tsunami racing around the world and set off a sonic boom that circled the globe twice. The underwater eruption in the South Pacific Ocean also blasted an enormous plume of water vapor into Earth’s stratosphere – enough to fill more than 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. The sheer amount of water vapor could be enough to temporarily affect Earth’s global average temperature. “We’ve never seen anything like it,” said Luis Millán, an atmospheric scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. He led a new study examining the amount of water vapor that the Tonga volcano injected into the stratosphere, the layer of the atmosphere between about 8 and 33 miles (12 and 53 kilometers) above Earth’s surface. This satellite image shows an intact Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai in April 2015, years before an explosive underwater volcanic eruption obliterated most of the Polynesian island in January 2022. Credit: NASA Earth Observatory image by Jesse Allen, using Landsat data from the U.S. Geological Survey In the study , published in Geophysical Research Letters, Millán and his colleagues estimate that the Tonga eruption sent around 146 teragrams (1 teragram equals a trillion grams) of water vapor into Earth’s stratosphere – equal to 10% of the water already present in that atmospheric layer. That’s nearly four times the amount of water vapor that scientists estimate the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines lofted into the stratosphere. Millán analyzed data from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on NASA’s Aura satellite, which measures atmospheric gases, including water vapor and ozone. After the Tonga volcano erupted, the MLS team started seeing water vapor readings that were off the charts. “We had to carefully inspect all the measurements in the plume to make sure they were trustworthy,” said Millán. An image from Jan. 16, 2022, shows the ash plume from the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcanic eruption that occurred the day before. An astronaut took a photograph of the plume from the International Space Station. Credit: NASA A Lasting Impression Volcanic eruptions rarely inject much water into the stratosphere. In the 18 years that NASA has been taking measurements, only two other eruptions – the 2008 Kasatochi event in Alaska and the 2015 Calbuco eruption in Chile – sent appreciable amounts of water vapor to such high altitudes. But those were mere blips compared to the Tonga event, and the water vapor from both previous eruptions dissipated quickly. The excess water vapor injected by the Tonga volcano, on the other hand, could remain in the stratosphere for several years. This extra water vapor could influence atmospheric chemistry, boosting certain chemical reactions that could temporarily worsen depletion of the ozone layer. It could also influence surface temperatures. Massive volcanic eruptions like Krakatoa and Mount Pinatubo typically cool Earth’s surface by ejecting gases, dust, and ash that reflect sunlight back into space. In contrast, the Tonga volcano didn’t inject large amounts of aerosols into the stratosphere, and the huge amounts of water vapor from the eruption may have a small, temporary warming effect, since water vapor traps heat. The effect would dissipate when the extra water vapor cycles out of the stratosphere and would not be enough to noticeably exacerbate climate change effects. The sheer amount of water injected into the stratosphere was likely only possible because the underwater volcano’s caldera – a basin-shaped depression usually formed after magma erupts or drains from a shallow chamber beneath the volcano – was at just the right depth in the ocean: about 490 feet (150 meters) down. Any shallower, and there wouldn’t have been enough seawater superheated by the erupting magma to account for the stratospheric water vapor values Millá\n\n\n---\n\n=== The thermal properties of submarine rhyolite lavas from Havre volcano (Kermadec arc, Pacific Ocean)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| Volcanica ===\nThe thermal properties of submarine rhyolite lavas from Havre volcano (Kermadec arc, Pacific Ocean) | Volcanica Main Navigation Main Content Sidebar Register Login Toggle navigation About About the Journal Submission instructions Policies Contact Current Issue Archives Covers The Volcanica Team Browse by Section Section: Research articles Section: Review articles Section: Reports Section: Methods Search Home Archives Vol. 8 No. 1 (2025) Articles The thermal properties of submarine rhyolite lavas from Havre volcano (Kermadec arc, Pacific Ocean) Article Sidebar PDF Read online Supplementary Material 1 Supplementary Material 2 Published: Jun 27, 2025 DOI: https://doi.org/10.30909/vol/jtfg1051 Keywords: Thermal conductivity Thermal diffusivity Specific heat capacity Submarine volcano Rhyolite lava Main Article Content Rebecca Carey School of Natural Sciences and CODES, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania 7001, Australia. https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2015-6419 Mike Heap Université de Strasbourg, CNRS, Institut Terre et Environnement de Strasbourg, UMR 7063, 5 rue Descartes, Strasbourg F-67084, France. https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4748-735X Samuel Mitchell School of Earth Sciences, Wills Memorial Building, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1RJ, UK. https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3224-5833 Fabian Wadsworth Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Theresienstr. 41, 80333 Munich, Germany. https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5341-208X Abstract The thermal properties of lavas are required for modelling volcanic and hydrothermal processes, yet are scarce for submarine lavas. Laboratory experiments, using the transient hot-strip method, are used to understand the role of porosity, glass content, and pore fluid type on the thermal properties of submarine lavas from Havre volcano. Thermal diffusivity and specific heat capacity do not change systematically with porosity; however, thermal conductivity decreases as porosity increases. The thermal conductivity of the submarine lavas is lower than for subaerial lavas with the same porosity, a consequence of their higher glass contents. We show that, using our data and effective medium models, the thermal properties of any lava can be estimated as long as their porosity, glass content, and void-filling fluid phase is known. This approach can be used to estimate properties for multiphase models for submarine eruption dynamics, hydrothermal system hydrology, cooling timescales, and heat flux calculations.

            "output": "Okay, here's a learning plan based on the provided articles, tailored for a 7-year-old learning about volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n**Overall Goal:** To introduce your daughter to volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean, focusing on the upcoming eruption of the Axial Seamount off the coast of Oregon, and the broader concept of the Ring of Fire.\n\n**Learning Plan Structure:**\n\nWe'll break this down into smaller, manageable chunks, using a variety of learning methods to keep it engaging.\n\n**I. Introducing Volcanoes (1-2 days)**\n\n*   **What are Volcanoes?**\n    *   **Explanation:** \"Imagine the Earth is like a giant apple pie, but instead of apples, it has hot, melted rock inside called magma. Sometimes, this hot rock wants to come out, so it finds a crack or weak spot in the Earth's crust (the pie crust) and bursts out! That's a volcano!\"\n    *   **Visual Aid:** Show pictures and videos of volcanoes erupting on land.  Keep it visually exciting (lava flowing, etc.), but avoid anything too scary.  Good search terms on YouTube Kids: \"volcano eruption kids,\" \"how volcanoes work for kids.\"\n    *   **Activity:** Build a simple model volcano using baking soda, vinegar, dish soap, and food coloring.  There are tons of easy recipes online. This makes the concept tangible.\n\n*   **Where do Volcanoes Form?**\n    *   **Explanation:** \"Most volcanoes are found where the Earth's big puzzle pieces, called tectonic plates, bump into each other or move apart.  It's like when you push two pieces of Play-Doh together, and some of it squishes up in the middle – that's kind of like how volcanoes form!\"\n    *   **Visual Aid:** Show a map of the world, highlighting the tectonic plates.  Explain that the edges of these plates are where most volcanoes and earthquakes happen.\n\n**II. Volcanoes in the Ocean (2-3 days)**\n\n*   **What are Underwater Volcanoes?**\n    *   **Explanation:** \"Guess what? Volcanoes can even be found under the ocean! It's the same idea – hot magma comes out from the Earth, but this time it happens under the water. When the hot lava touches the cold water, it cools down very quickly and makes interesting shapes.\"\n    *   **Visual Aid:** Show pictures and videos of underwater volcanoes.  Search terms: \"underwater volcano eruption,\" \"hydrothermal vents.\" Highlight the unique life that can be found near these volcanoes (tube worms, etc.).\n    *   **Activity:** Draw a picture of an underwater volcano.  Label the parts (magma chamber, vent, lava flow).\n\n*   **The Ring of Fire**\n    *   **Explanation:** \"There's a special place around the Pacific Ocean called the 'Ring of Fire.' It's called that because there are SO MANY volcanoes and earthquakes there. It's like a giant circle of activity!\"\n    *   **Visual Aid:** Use a map of the Ring of Fire (the Wikipedia article has a good one). Point out the different continents and countries that are part of the Ring of Fire (North and South America, Asia, New Zealand).\n    *   **Activity:** Make a \"Ring of Fire\" bracelet using beads.  Use different colored beads to represent volcanoes and earthquakes.\n\n**III. Focusing on the Axial Seamount (2-3 days)**\n\n*   **The Axial Seamount**\n    *   **Explanation:** \"Right now, scientists are watching a volcano under the ocean off the coast of Oregon, in the United States. It's called the Axial Seamount, and they think it might erupt soon! It's like the Earth is getting ready to pop a little underwater pimple.\"\n    *   **Visual Aid:** Show a map of Oregon and point out the location of the Axial Seamount (300 miles offshore).  Show pictures of the volcano.\n    *   **Activity:** Find Oregon on a globe or map. Discuss what kinds of animals live in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n*   **Why is this volcano special?**\n    *   **Explanation:** \"Scientists have put special instruments on the volcano to watch it closely. They can see the ground swelling up and lots of tiny earthquakes happening. Because they're watching it so carefully, they can learn a lot about how volcanoes work!\"\n    *   **Visual Aid:** Explain how seismometers work (detecting earthquakes).\n    *   **Activity:** Pretend to be a scientist monitoring the Axial Seamount.  Keep a \"volcano journal\" and draw pictures of what you observe (earthquakes, swelling).\n\n*   **What Happens When it Erupts?**\n    *   **Explanation:** \"When the Axial Seamount erupts, it won't be a big, scary explosion like some volcanoes. Instead, lava will slowly ooze out. It won't cause a tsunami or hurt anyone on land.\"\n    *   **Visual Aid:** Show videos of shield volcanoes erupting in Hawaii or Iceland (gentle lava flows).\n    *   **Activity:** Discuss the difference between explosive and effusive eruptions.\n\n**IV. Review and Extension (1 day)**\n\n*   **Review:** Go over the main points of what you've learned.  Ask questions like: \"What is magma?\", \"Where is the Ring of Fire?\", \"Why are scientists watching the Axial Seamount?\"\n*   **Extension:**\n    *   Read a book about volcanoes (there are many age-appropriate options).\n    *   Watch a documentary about the ocean or volcanoes.\n    *   Research other volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n**Key Considerations for a 7-Year-Old:**\n\n*   **Keep it simple:** Use clear, easy-to-understand language.\n*   **Be visual:** Use lots of pictures, videos, and diagrams.\n*   **Make it interactive:** Include hands-on activities.\n*   **Be patient:** Learning takes time! Don't rush through the material.\n*   **Connect to their interests:** If your daughter is interested in animals, focus on the creatures that live near volcanoes. If she likes art, encourage her to draw and paint volcanoes.\n*   **Adapt:** Adjust the pace and content based on your daughter's interest and understanding.\n\n**Adapting the Content from the Articles:**\n\n*   **CNN, Fox12, ABC News, Statesman Journal, OPB, Earth.com:** These articles focus on the *imminent eruption* of the Axial Seamount. Use this as the \"hook\" to get her interested. Explain that scientists are watching this volcano closely.\n*   **Wikipedia (Ring of Fire, List of Volcanoes):** Use these for maps and lists to show the *global* scale of volcanoes in the Pacific.\n*   **NOAA (What is the Ring of Fire?, Do Volcanoes Occur in the Ocean?, Deep Ocean Volcanoes):** These are great resources for *basic explanations* and videos of underwater volcanoes.\n*   **NASA (Tonga Eruption):** While this is a different volcano, it can be used to illustrate the *power* of underwater eruptions.  Focus on the visuals (the plume of water vapor) and the fact that scientists are studying these events.\n*   **USGS, Smithsonian Ocean:** Reliable sources for *general information* about volcanoes.\n\nBy breaking down the information into manageable chunks and using a variety of learning methods, you can create an engaging and educational experience for your 7-year-old. Good luck!\n"

I'll be your friendly tutor, ready to explain things in a way that's easy to understand and fun!\n\n**Our Volcano Adventure: Exploring the Pacific's Fiery Secrets!**\n\n**Overall Goal:** To learn about volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean, especially the exciting Axial Seamount, and discover the amazing \"Ring of Fire\"!\n\n**Learning Plan:**\n\nWe'll have lots of fun learning about volcanoes with cool pictures, videos, and even some fun activities! We'll take our time and learn something new each day.\n\n**I. What are Volcanoes? (Day 1 & 2)**\n\n*   **What are Volcanoes?**\n    *   **Me (Tutor):** \"Hey there, adventurer! Imagine the Earth is like a yummy chocolate chip cookie, but instead of chocolate chips, it has hot, melted rock inside called *magma*. This magma is super hot, like the stuff that makes fireworks sparkle! Sometimes, this hot rock wants to come out and play, so it finds a crack or weak spot in the Earth's crust (the cookie's surface) and *BOOM*! It bursts out! That's a volcano!\"\n    *   **Visual Aid:** I'll show you some awesome pictures and videos of volcanoes erupting on land! Think of them like giant fountains of fiery rock! We'll watch some cool videos on YouTube Kids, like \"volcano eruption kids\" or \"how volcanoes work for kids.\" (Make sure a grown-up is with us while we watch!)\n    *   **Activity:** Let's build our own volcano! We'll use baking soda, vinegar, dish soap, and food coloring to make it erupt! It'll be like a science magic trick! We can find an easy recipe online together.\n\n*   **Where do Volcanoes Form?**\n    *   **Me (Tutor):** \"Now, where do these volcanoes like to hang out? Well, imagine the Earth is made of giant puzzle pieces, called *tectonic plates*. These plates are always moving, but very, very slowly. Sometimes they bump into each other, or they move apart. When they do, it's like squeezing a tube of toothpaste – the magma can squirt out and make a volcano!\"\n    *   **Visual Aid:** I'll show you a map of the world with these big puzzle pieces. The edges of the puzzle pieces are where most volcanoes and earthquakes happen. We'll point them out together!\n    *   **Activity:** Let's play with Play-Doh! We'll push two pieces of Play-Doh together and see how it squishes up in the middle. That's kind of like how volcanoes form when the Earth's plates bump into each other!\n\n**II. Volcanoes in the Ocean! (Day 3, 4, & 5)**\n\n*   **What are Underwater Volcanoes?**\n    *   **Me (Tutor):** \"Guess what? Volcanoes can even live under the sea! It's the same idea – hot magma comes out from the Earth, but this time it's underwater. When the hot lava touches the cold water, it cools down super fast and makes cool, lumpy shapes, like giant blobs of rock! It also creates some amazing underwater chimneys that spout out hot water!\"\n    *   **Visual Aid:** Let's watch some videos of underwater volcanoes! Search for \"underwater volcano eruption\" or \"hydrothermal vents\" on YouTube Kids (with a grown-up). We'll see some strange and wonderful creatures that live near these volcanoes, like tube worms!\n    *   **Activity:** Let's draw a picture of an underwater volcano! We can label the parts: the magma chamber (where the hot rock lives), the vent (where the lava comes out), and the lava flow (the hot rock flowing into the water).\n\n*   **The Ring of Fire**\n    *   **Me (Tutor):** \"There's a special place around the Pacific Ocean called the 'Ring of Fire.' It's like a giant circle of volcanoes and earthquakes! It's called that because there are SO MANY of them there. It's like a super-active neighborhood for volcanoes!\"\n    *   **Visual Aid:** I'll show you a map of the Ring of Fire. We'll point out the different continents and countries that are part of it, like North and South America, Asia, and even New Zealand!\n    *   **Activity:** Let's make a \"Ring of Fire\" bracelet! We'll use different colored beads to represent volcanoes and earthquakes. Red for volcanoes, maybe blue for earthquakes?\n\n**III. Zooming in on the Axial Seamount! (Day 6, 7, & 8)**\n\n*   **The Axial Seamount**\n    *   **Me (Tutor):** \"Guess what? Scientists are watching a volcano *right now* that's under the ocean off the coast of Oregon, in the United States! It's called the Axial Seamount, and they think it might erupt soon! It's like the Earth is getting ready to pop a little underwater bubble.\"\n    *   **Visual Aid:** I'll show you a map of Oregon and point out where the Axial Seamount is. It's about 300 miles away from the coast! We can also look at some pictures of the volcano itself.\n    *   **Activity:** Let's find Oregon on a globe or map! What kinds of animals live in the Pacific Northwest? Maybe we can draw some of them!\n\n*   **Why is this volcano special?**\n    *   **Me (Tutor):** \"This volcano is super special because scientists have put special tools on it to watch it closely. These tools can feel the ground swelling up and lots of tiny earthquakes happening. It's like listening to the Earth's heartbeat! Because they're watching it so carefully, they can learn a lot about how volcanoes work!\"\n    *   **Visual Aid:** I'll explain how seismometers work. They're like super-sensitive earthquake detectors!\n    *   **Activity:** Let's pretend to be scientists watching the Axial Seamount! We can keep a \"volcano journal\" and draw pictures of what we observe: earthquakes, swelling, maybe even some bubbles rising from the seafloor!\n\n*   **What Happens When it Erupts?**\n    *   **Me (Tutor):** \"When the Axial Seamount erupts, it won't be a big, scary explosion like some volcanoes. Instead, lava will slowly *ooze* out, like honey pouring from a jar. It won't cause a tsunami or hurt anyone on land, because it's so deep underwater.\"\n    *   **Visual Aid:** Let's watch some videos of shield volcanoes erupting in Hawaii or Iceland. They have gentle lava flows that look like rivers of fire!\n    *   **Activity:** Let's talk about the difference between volcanoes that explode and volcanoes that ooze lava. Which one do you think is more exciting?\n\n**IV. Wrapping Up Our Volcano Adventure! (Day 9)**\n\n*   **Review:** \"Okay, adventurer, let's see what we've learned! What is magma? Where is the Ring of Fire? Why are scientists watching the Axial Seamount?\"\n*   **Extension:**\n    *   Read a book about volcanoes!\n    *   Watch a documentary about the ocean or volcanoes!\n    *   Research other volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean! Maybe we can find the tallest one!\n\n**Remember!**\n\n*   We'll take our time and make sure you understand everything.\n*   We'll have lots of fun with pictures, videos, and activities.\n*   If you have any questions, just ask!\n\nLet's start our volcano adventure!
