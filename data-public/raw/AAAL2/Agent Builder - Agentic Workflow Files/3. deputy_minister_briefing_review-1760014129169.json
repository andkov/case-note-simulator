Acronyms:**\n\n*   **AIS:** Aquatic Invasive Species - Defined in the first paragraph.\n*   **EID:** Mentioned in Background in reference to County of Newell’s Boating Safety and Aquatic Invasive Species Bylaw (2001-21) supports the EID program. This acronym is not defined.\n*   **Recommendation:** Define EID.\n\n**4. Research References:**\n\n*   The briefing mentions \"economic assessments.\" The specific reports or sources of these assessments should be listed in the \"ATTACHMENT\" section or a separate \"REFERENCES\" section.\n*   The jurisdictional comparison notes research is needed. It is better to have some preliminary research included in the attachment.\n*   **Recommendation:** Include details of the economic assessments and jurisdictional research in the attachment section\n\n**5. Stakeholder Reaction:**\n\n*   The briefing identifies key stakeholders.\n*   It anticipates mixed reactions.\n*   **Missing Information:** The briefing **does not** clearly outline steps *already taken* to engage with stakeholders. It only mentions future consultations. Even if minimal, some initial engagement (e.g., internal discussions with relevant departments) should be noted.\n*   **Recommendation:** Add a sentence or two outlining any preliminary steps taken to understand stakeholder perspectives, even if it's just internal consultations. For example: \"Preliminary discussions have been held with representatives from Alberta Parks and Alberta Environment and Protected Areas to gauge initial reactions to the watercraft tax concept.\"\n\n**Specific Recommendations and Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Purpose:** Consider adding a sentence that explicitly states the desired outcome of the decision. For example: \"The desired outcome is to secure Ministerial approval to proceed with a feasibility study and stakeholder consultation regarding a watercraft tax to enhance AIS prevention efforts.\"\n*   **Background:** Expand slightly on the existing AIS prevention programs. What are the specific activities funded? This provides a clearer picture of the current situation.\n*   **Analysis:** Strengthen the link between the watercraft tax and the Minister's Mandate Letter items. Be more specific about how the tax would directly support environmental sustainability and responsible resource management.\n*   **Financial Implications:** Provide more detail on what the $50,000 - $100,000 would cover (e.g., consultant fees, travel expenses, data analysis software).\n*   **Stakeholder Reaction:** Be more specific about the potential concerns of boaters and tourism operators. What are they likely to object to? This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the issue.\n*   **Next Steps:** The timelines provided are very high level. Provide rough dates to ensure that the Minister knows when the item is expected to return\n*   **Attachment:** Consider adding a one-page summary of AIS prevention programs in other jurisdictions (e.g., BC, Manitoba, select US states) to the attachment. This would provide the Minister with a quick reference point.\n\nBy addressing these points, the briefing note will be more comprehensive, accurate, and persuasive, providing the Minister with the information needed to make an informed decision.\n"

Where will this money come from?\n    *   More importantly, it **completely misses the mark on multi-year forecasting**. The *entire purpose* of exploring a watercraft tax is to generate long-term funding. The briefing *must* include projections of potential revenue from the tax over multiple years (e.g., 3-5 years) under different tax rate scenarios. These should be in a table.\n    *   There is no discussion of the ongoing costs associated with administering the watercraft tax (e.g., collection, enforcement).\n    *   The financial implications section needs to be significantly expanded.\n\n*   **Recommended Option:** **(Pass)**\n    *   Option 1 is correctly identified as the recommended option.\n    *   Option 3 is correctly identified as the status quo.\n\n*   **Recommendations: Financial, Reputational, & Stakeholder Impacts:** **(Partial Pass)**\n    *   Stakeholder impacts are addressed reasonably well, with identification of key groups and anticipated reactions.\n    *   Reputational impacts are touched upon (negative public perception), but could be strengthened.\n    *   Financial impacts are weak, as noted above.\n\n*   **Options Analysis:** **(Fail)**\n    *   The options presented are inadequate. They are too high-level and lack creative solutions.\n    *   Where is the option for a phased implementation? Could they start with a pilot project in a specific region or for a specific type of watercraft?\n    *   Why aren't there options that consider different technology solutions for managing the tax or inspection process?\n    *   The options analysis needs a complete overhaul to consider a broader range of approaches.\n    *   Given that this is a technology ministry, it should include options such as developing an app to manage the \"Clean, Drain, Dry\" process, report inspections, etc.\n\n*   **Speed/Timeline:** **(Partial Pass)**\n    *   The timeline for the feasibility study and consultations is provided, which is good.\n    *   However, the briefing lacks a sense of urgency or a clear articulation of *why* this issue needs to be addressed quickly.

While the note provides a general overview of the issue, several areas require significant revisions to meet the Deputy Minister's expectations and ensure informed decision-making.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe briefing note, as it stands, receives a score of 4.5/10. The primary areas of concern are the inadequate financial analysis, the narrow scope of the options analysis, and the complete omission of any consideration of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\n**Specific Feedback and Required Revisions:**\n\nPlease address the following points in a revised version of the briefing note:\n\n**1. Financial Decisions & Multi-Year Forecasts:**\n\n*   **Deficiency:** The current briefing note lacks a clear identification of the funding source for the feasibility study. It also fails to project potential revenue from the watercraft tax over multiple years. The financial implications section is weak.\n*   **Example:** The briefing note states: \"The recommended Option 1 (feasibility study and stakeholder consultation) will require funding for research, analysis, and consultation activities. The exact cost will depend on the scope of the study, but it is estimated to be in the range of $50,000 - $100,000.\" This statement is insufficient.\n*   **Required Action:**\n    *   **Identify the specific source of funds** for the $50,000 - $100,000 feasibility study.\n    *   **Develop a multi-year revenue projection table** (3-5 years) showing potential revenue from the watercraft tax under different tax rate scenarios (e.g., \\$25, \\$50, \\$75 per watercraft).\n    *   **Include a detailed breakdown of anticipated implementation and administrative costs** associated with the tax (e.g., collection, enforcement, IT systems).\n    *   **Discuss the ongoing costs** associated with administering the watercraft tax (e.g., collection, enforcement).\n\n**2. Options Analysis:**\n\n*   **Deficiency:** The options presented are too high-level and lack creative solutions. The briefing does not consider phased implementation, technology solutions, or different funding models.\n*   **Example:** The existing options are limited to: 1) feasibility study, 2) enhanced funding from general revenue, and 3) status quo.\n*   **Required Action:**\n    *   **Expand the options analysis** to include a broader range of approaches. Consider:\n        *   **Phased Implementation:** An option for a pilot project in a specific region or for a specific type of watercraft.\n        *   **Technology Solutions:** An option to develop an app to manage the \"Clean, Drain, Dry\" process, report inspections, etc.\n        *   **Alternative Funding Models:** Explore other potential revenue sources or funding mechanisms.\n\n**3. AI Consideration:**\n\n*   **Deficiency:** The briefing note completely fails to address how AI has been considered and why it is or is not a suitable solution for various aspects of AIS prevention and tax administration.\n*   **Example:** There is no mention of AI anywhere in the current briefing note.\n*   **Required Action:**\n    *   **Add a dedicated section** discussing the evaluation of AI applications. Address the following questions:\n        *   Could AI be used to analyze inspection data to identify high-risk vessels or areas?\n        *   Could AI be used to develop a more effective public awareness campaign?\n        *   Could AI be used to automate parts of the inspection process?\n        *   Explain why AI is or is not a suitable solution for these applications.\n\n**4. Speed/Timeline:**\n\n*   **Deficiency:** The briefing lacks a sense of urgency or a clear articulation of *why* this issue needs to be addressed quickly.\n*   **Required Action:**\n    *   **Clearly articulate the timeline** for action.\n    *   **Explain the reasons why** this issue needs to be addressed promptly. Is there a specific threat on the horizon? Are neighboring jurisdictions taking action that requires Alberta to respond?\n\n**5. Data and Legal Opinion:**\n\n*   **Deficiency:** Lack of supporting data and clarity on legal review.\n*   **Required Action:**\n    *   **Provide relevant data** on inspection numbers, intercepted contaminated boats, origin of boats, and compliance rates.\n    *   **Confirm whether a legal opinion** has been requested or obtained regarding the province's authority to implement a watercraft tax. Summarize key findings or explain why a legal opinion has not been sought.\n\n**6. Appendix:**\n\n*   **Required Action:**\n    *   Move the \"Aquatic Invasive Species Prevention Program Details\" to an appendix to maintain the conciseness of the main briefing note.\n\nI understand that these revisions require significant effort. However, they are essential to ensure that the Minister has the information needed to make a well-informed decision. Please submit the revised briefing note by [Date - allow reasonable time for revisions, e.g., one week].\n\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or require further clarification.\n"

These species pose a significant environmental and economic threat to the province. The government has focused on prevention, primarily through watercraft inspections and public education initiatives like \"Clean, Drain, Dry.\" Key actions include collaboration between Alberta Parks, Alberta Environment and Protected Areas, and other agencies.\n\n• Mandatory watercraft inspections are in place, particularly for vessels entering Alberta from higher-risk areas (e.g., Manitoba, Ontario, southwestern United States). Failure to stop at an open inspection station could result in a fine of $690.\n\n• It is illegal to transport watercraft with the drain plug still in place.\n\n• Economic assessments have estimated the potential costs of a quagga/zebra mussel infestation at over $75 million annually.\n\n• The County of Newell’s Boating Safety and Aquatic Invasive Species Bylaw (2001-21) supports the EID program.\n\nThe government is now considering a watercraft tax for every watercraft in Alberta to further fund AIS prevention efforts.\n\n• This consideration is new, and there is no established public record on this specific proposal.\n\n\n\nANALYSIS\n\nAlberta's primary strategy is to prevent the introduction of quagga and zebra mussels. Prevention is more cost-effective than managing an infestation. The government has conducted economic assessments to justify the investment in prevention programs. The addition of a watercraft tax will require careful consideration. This work aligns with the Minister's Mandate Letter items of supporting environmental sustainability and responsible resource management and key government priorities including protecting Alberta's natural resources and promoting economic diversification.\n\n\n\nKey Considerations\n\n• Efficacy of Inspection Stations: Evaluate the effectiveness of current inspection station locations and hours of operation. Data on inspection numbers, intercepted contaminated boats, and origin of boats is needed.\n\n• Compliance Rates: Assess compliance rates with mandatory inspection requirements and \"Clean, Drain, Dry\" practices. Targeted education campaigns for specific user groups (e.g., anglers, recreational boaters, commercial operators) may be needed.\n\n• Stakeholder Impact of Watercraft Tax: A watercraft tax could generate revenue for AIS prevention but may face opposition from boaters and the tourism industry. A thorough cost-benefit analysis and stakeholder consultation are essential. A legal opinion is needed to assess the province's authority to implement such a tax.\n\n\n\nJurisdictional Comparisons\n\nOther jurisdictions, such as British Columbia, also have robust AIS prevention programs. Alberta and British Columbia have a joint watercraft passport program for boaters who frequently travel between the two provinces. Research into how other provinces and states fund their AIS programs (e.g., through general revenue, user fees, or dedicated taxes) is needed.\n\n\n\nOptions Under Consideration\n\n\n\n• Option 1 (Recommended): Conduct a comprehensive feasibility study and stakeholder consultation on the implementation of a watercraft tax, including a cost-benefit analysis and legal review.\n\n• Pros: Potential for dedicated funding stream for AIS prevention; may enhance program effectiveness.\n\n• Cons: Potential opposition from boaters and tourism industry; administrative costs of implementation; legal challenges.\n\n• Risks/Mitigation: Negative public perception (mitigation: transparent communication); legal challenges (mitigation: thorough legal review); low compliance (mitigation: incentives/enforcement).\n\n• Option 2: Enhance existing AIS prevention programs through increased funding from general revenue, without implementing a watercraft tax.\n\n• Pros: Avoids potential opposition to a new tax; simpler implementation.\n\n• Cons: Funding may be less stable and subject to budget fluctuations; may not be sufficient to address the growing threat of AIS.\n\n• Risks/Mitigation: Insufficient funding (mitigation: prioritize high-impact activities); lack of public awareness (mitigation: enhance existing education programs).\n\n• Option 3 (Status Quo): Maintain current AIS prevention programs at existing funding levels.\n\n• Pros: No immediate costs or disruptions.\n\n• Cons: May be inadequate to prevent the introduction and spread of AIS, given the increasing risk; could result in significant economic and environmental damage in the long term.\n\n• Risks/Mitigation: Increased risk of AIS introduction (mitigation: enhance monitoring efforts); potential for costly infestation (mitigation: develop a robust rapid response plan).\n\n\n\nThe attached Aquatic Invasive Species Prevention Program Details demonstrates the current scope of Alberta's AIS prevention efforts. Benefits of the recommended direction include a more informed decision-making process regarding the watercraft tax and a better understanding of its potential impacts.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe recommended Option 1 (feasibility study and stakeholder consultation) will require funding for research, analysis, and consultation activities. The exact cost will depend on the scope of the study, but it is estimated to be in the range of $50,000 - $100,000. No financial implications if the government continues with the status quo.\n\n\n\nSTAKEHOLDER REACTION\n\nKey stakeholders include recreational boaters, anglers, tourism operators, environmental groups, irrigation districts, power companies, and municipalities. Anticipate mixed reactions to the watercraft tax proposal. Boaters and tourism operators may oppose the tax, while environmental groups and infrastructure operators may support it. Consultations should involve these groups to gather feedback and address concerns.\n\n\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nIf the Minister approves Option 1, the following steps will be taken:\n\n• Initiate a comprehensive feasibility study on the implementation of a watercraft tax (timeline: 2 months).\n\n• Conduct stakeholder consultations with key groups to gather feedback and address concerns (timeline: 1 month).\n\n• Analyze the results of the feasibility study and stakeholder consultations (timeline: 1 month).\n\n• Present findings and recommendations to the Minister for a final decision (timeline: 1 month).\n\n\n\nATTACHMENT\n\n• Aquatic Invasive Species Prevention Program Details\n\n\n\nCONTACT\n\n[Your Name]\n\nSenior Policy Advisor\n\n[Your Contact Information]",
