# Systems Thinking: Understanding Connections and Goals

Systems thinking is about seeing how parts connect — understanding the goals, flows, feedback loops, and dependencies that make up a larger system.

A system is not merely a collection of parts; it is a set of interacting components working together toward a shared goal or purpose.

## Systems Composition and Alignment with AI

### Systems Composition

This diagram illustrates how systems are composed:

1. **Tasks**: Individual actions performed in isolation.
2. **Processes**: Sequences of tasks connected by defined inputs and outputs.
3. **Workflows**: Linked processes forming a cohesive flow.
4. **Systems**: Workflows integrated with feedback and continuous improvement mechanisms.
5. **Ecosystems**: Networks of multiple systems that interact, adapt, and evolve together.

This progression can also reflect an organization:
- From individuals performing their tasks,
- To teams, departments, and entire networks working collectively toward shared goals.

### AI Alignment with Systems Thinking

The diagram also shows how artificial intelligence aligns with systems thinking:

- **AI Assistants** (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT): Operate at the task level.
- **AI Agents**: Function at the process level.
- **Agentic Workflows**: Correspond to systems, integrating multiple steps with feedback loops.
- **AI Orchestration**: Represents ecosystems, where multiple intelligent agents and humans collaborate toward shared organizational objectives.

## Applying Systems Thinking

1. **Look Beyond Individual Tasks**  
    Do not only ask, “What am I doing?” — instead, consider, “How does what I’m doing affect the next step or the next person?”  
    Systems thinking is about recognizing those interdependencies and understanding how actions influence the broader flow of work.

2. **Identify Key Inputs, Outputs, and Feedback Loops**  
    Ask yourself: What comes in, what goes out, and how does feedback reshape the process over time?  
    That is how systems learn, adapt, and improve.

3. **Focus on Patterns Rather Than Steps**  
    Instead of designing for isolated exceptions, design for what repeats.  
    If something occurs frequently, it likely represents an underlying system — and that is where the most meaningful improvements can be made.

4. **Connect Across Boundaries**  
    Most challenges do not reside neatly within a single team — they exist in the spaces between them.  
    Recognizing these connections helps identify where information becomes stalled, duplicated, or misaligned.

5. **Align Everything to the System’s Goal**  
    Every component — whether a person, process, or tool — should contribute toward a shared outcome.  
    This alignment ensures that systems remain coherent and that the organization moves forward collectively, rather than in separate or competing directions.

## Where Does Information Break Down?

Think of situations where several teams request the same information — each in slightly different ways.  
These are the spaces between teams where most problems tend to occur.

At that point, the information begins to fragment into silos — it is no longer connected across the organization.  
When something changes, those updates fail to flow through the system.

That is when duplication, rework, and wasted effort begin to appear — the symptoms of a disconnected system.

A worked example will be shown later to illustrate how systems thinking and agentic workflows can help reconnect those pieces and reduce friction across the process.
